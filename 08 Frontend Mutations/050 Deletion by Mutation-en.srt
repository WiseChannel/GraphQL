1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,140
Our list of songs keeps on growing and growing and while we have the ability to manually delete them

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,110
using the Lango lab interface over here it would be really nice if our users could see little X off

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,560
to the right hand side that they could click to delete an individual song.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,950
Hopefully that would delete the song and any additional associated lyrics with it.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,940
Let's plan out how we're going to tackle this feature inside of this section.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,540
So at present I'm going to mention two big things I expect to change about the application.

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,860
I want to see some type of button on the right hand side that a user can click and whenever they click

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,010
it the data source should automatically be updated by deleting that individual song.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,010
So in my mind I'm kind of thinking of two different pieces of code that we're going to have to add.

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,830
One piece of code on the react side that will delete the existing Orosius me that will show an icon

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,140
over here that the user can click to delete the song and the will also have to add an event handler

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:07,360
that will probably call a mutation to make sure that the song actually gets deleted.

13
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,770
Remember any time that we're talking about editing creating or deleting a record in our data source

14
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,300
we automatically want to be thinking about mutations.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,200
So we're going to approach this mutation the exact same way we've approached all of the other queries

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,060
and mutations.

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,560
Well all the other two I should say that we've worked on so far.

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,480
We're going to do this by first starting inside of graphical and writing mutation out by hand and then

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,860
migrating that mutation over to live inside of one of our components.

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,150
So let's flip over to graphical and we're going to give this a shot.

21
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,340
The first thing I'm going to do is run our query to printout our entire list of songs.

22
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,030
So I'm going to place my opening query we're going to look at our list of songs and I'm going to say

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,750
give me the ID for each individual song so we can clearly see that we've got several ideas for each

24
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,330
of the songs in here getting the ideas relevant because when we tried to delete a song we're going to

25
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,720
have to tell our back end exactly which song we want to delete.

26
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:17,150
So presumably we're going to add in the ID of the song we want to delete as a type of Querrey variable.

27
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,370
Remember these are here to learn a little bit more about the mutation itself and how it's going to work.

28
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,540
We can open up the docs panel on the top right hand side.

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,550
So I've got my mutation section open and you'll see that one of the mutations we have available is delete

30
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,150
song and the purpose of this is to delete a song.

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,620
Totally reasonable.

32
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,770
OK.

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,100
So let's give this a shot.

34
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,430
We're going to write the mutation out here and run it just to make sure we can delete an individual

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,090
song first.

36
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,510
I'm going to start by modifying our Querrey just a little bit to see the not name but the title of a

37
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,120
song.

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,660
So we'll say that I want to delete the first song and my list which is called Night to deleted I would

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,070
to make sure that I copy the ID over here the entire thing because I'm going to need to reference that

40
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,950
very specific ID when I write out my mutation.

41
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:09,770
OK.

42
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,770
So let's write her mutation out.

43
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,460
So we're going to start off by writing a named mutation and I'm going to make it a named imitation because

44
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,690
I want to use a query variable to use to pass in the various specific ID.

45
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,040
So let's start off by doing the query variable first.

46
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:34,710
I'm going to say that I want to pass in an ID as a parameter and the ID of the record I want to delete.

47
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,850
Is that right there.

48
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,260
So the 5 8 9 5 8 9 ending in 3 5 7 and 9 and 3 5 7.

49
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,610
OK.

50
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,290
So this part looks good down here.

51
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,980
You'll notice I got a red squiggly around ID.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,830
Meaning there's an error here and the error is just saying hey you haven't actually used this query

53
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,070
variable anywhere.

54
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,280
So if you define a query variable graphical wants to see you actually make use of it.

55
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,580
Otherwise it's going to think that you're probably making a mistake somewhere.

56
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,300
So now we can work on the named mutation flew right out the mutation keyword and then we will apply

57
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,050
a name to the mutation and then remember the order of arguments here.

58
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,550
We treat this naming mutation like a sort of function that we're going to pass the idea into.

59
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:26,040
So we do dollar sign type then name dollar sign.

60
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,230
So we'll do ID that's going to be the name of this parameter.

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,140
It's going to be of type string.

62
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:41,330
Then we delete song and then we're going to do the name of the parameter which is ID and the source

63
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:48,010
of that value or that value is going to come from the variable Id like so then we need to make sure

64
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,450
that we ask for at least one thing in return the back end will say Just give me the idea of the record

65
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,630
that was deleted.

66
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,230
Now you'll notice that the we've got a little bit of a red highlight here and it says that we are using

67
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,880
an idea of type string when type ID was expected.

68
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,800
So the back end that I've put together has a little bit different assumption about the IDs that we're

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,930
passing around here in the past application that we worked on we were saying that the IDs were always

70
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,290
of type string.

71
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,810
This time around I change their type to be of type ID.

72
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,270
We'll talk about exactly why we do that in the next application that we work in.

73
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,870
We can view this idea right here.

74
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,450
It is just another type just like the string type just like the integer types that we've used previously.

75
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,070
It is just another primitive type available to us in our graphical schema.

76
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,550
So this is looking pretty good now.

77
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,890
I'm going to run the query run the mutation I get back to the ID of the record that was deleted and

78
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:51,370
now I'm going to rerun my mutation in my query to get my big list of songs.

79
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,370
I'm going to expect that first song to be missing now.

80
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,890
I don't want to delete the mutation so I'm going to comment it out by pressing command forward slash

81
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,030
to comment it out.

82
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,920
And you do same thing for the query variables Well actually I can't comment that some is going to delete

83
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,320
it.

84
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,910
Now we're going to write out the mutation how I keep saying mutation excuse me the queery to get our

85
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,110
list of songs.

86
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,110
So say give me my list of songs and I want to know the title.

87
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,930
And let's do that ideas well for each of them.

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,940
So now you'll notice that the very first song that I was working with is no longer here specifically

89
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,660
the one that had the ending idea of three five seven.

90
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,210
So looks like that mutation definitely worked the way I expect it to work.

91
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,390
So I think that we're in a pretty good place to move forward.

92
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,520
We're going to take a quick break and then come back and move this nutation into our song list component

93
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,200
and wire it up to our component using the graphical helper.

94
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,990
So let's take care of that in the next section.
