1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,480
In the last section we started working on our ads song mutation inside of our song create component.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,720
And we ran into a huge show issue when we realized that whenever we call this mutation we have to pass

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,540
in the title of the new song.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,590
But the title is only available inside of the component itself.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,600
In theory we want to call the mutation from this on submit event handler right here.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,140
So we have to somehow communicate the title of the song into that mutation.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,970
So that's what we're going to take care of inside of this section.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,830
We're going to figure out how to communicate from the component to the mutation that we're writing over

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,790
here.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,070
OK let's get to it.

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,810
I think that a good way of approaching this is to work inside of graphical because ultimately we're

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:52,200
going to use a little feature of graph cool syntax that is available to us inside of graphical as well

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,270
inside of graphical.

14
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,710
I've still got the mutation written out right here.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,600
So I've still got the mutation keyword.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,020
I'm still calling the ADD song mutation and all that kind of good stuff.

17
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:09,530
To take care of this issue of somehow communicating data into our mutation.

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,550
I want to think of mutations like a function.

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,150
We're going to pass some argument to it from some outside source.

20
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:23,480
We make use of the system inside of graft well called queery variables which is defined down here at

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:31,430
the bottom left of the interface queery variables are used to inject some variable from outside the

22
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:37,320
query into the query query variables are most frequently used inside of graph.

23
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,460
Well absolutely with mutations and we'll also use them with queries some time when ever we want to have

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,190
a reata component that somehow customizes the query in some fashion which is extremely helpful whenever

25
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,790
we start thinking about say filtering or pagination.

26
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:59,930
If you want to get only the first page of data from a query then the component needs to tell the query

27
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,780
that has been made.

28
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:08,330
Hey I only want the first page of data to communicate from our re-act component to the query or mutation

29
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,870
itself.

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,710
We make use of this query variable's system.

31
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,790
So let's talk a little bit about how these query variables work.

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,430
First the big thing to understand here is that the real change that's going to go on to make use of

33
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,460
these query variables is how we write out the mutation and how we write out queries to make use of query

34
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,780
variables.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,210
Going to flip over to a slide that's going to show us a little bit alternative syntax to mutation rate

36
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,580
here that will help us understand exactly how we're going to modify that mutation.

37
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,370
Look at it.

38
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,920
So this looks really ugly.

39
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,360
I can tell you right now it does look ugly I can't.

40
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,410
I can discredit that.

41
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,190
It just it just looks ugly.

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,010
But we're going to stick with it anyways.

43
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,550
First there's a couple of changes in how this thing looks compared to the Querrey or the mutation that

44
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,950
we have in graphical right now.

45
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,540
So I first want to point out what is similar.

46
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,800
And then we'll talk about what is not similar.

47
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,510
So we still have this mutation keyword.

48
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,450
We have the curly brace on the end and then inside of the mutation I'm still calling add song and saying

49
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
hey here's a title that I want to pass in.

50
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,570
So all that stuff is still here.

51
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,760
So we're really adding on to the mutation like you know we look at the saying and we look back at the

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,480
slide.

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,940
We're really adding additional syntax into this thing.

54
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,860
OK.

55
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,100
So let's talk about each element that we're going to add in here first Emily after the key word mutation

56
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,120
we're going to add a name for the mutation in this case.

57
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
Uncoiling it adds song.

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,440
This is a little bit misleading because you might be thinking Well Stephen didn't we already Name the

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,620
mutation light inside of it and we are the coolest thing add song down here.

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,890
Well yes we did.

61
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,400
The purpose of ADD song out here is to have more make kind of.

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,110
You can get of.

63
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,830
You should really imagine this mutation now as being a sort of function that we can call from anywhere

64
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,680
inside of our application.

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:06,890
So I would expect that by saying Hey everybody I have a mutation called add song when you call it it's

66
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,940
going to invoke the ADD song mutation on our server.

67
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,230
In practice the name of the mutation right here can be anything we really want.

68
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,990
So it's not tied to any part of our back and schema it's not tied to the graph to all server in the

69
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:29,900
back end it's really something for naming it for our personal use then named mutation will take some

70
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:36,650
number of parameters or arguments into it just as we are used to with an individual mutation call like

71
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,070
add song down here.

72
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:44,600
But you'll notice that the argument list is a little bit a little bit unexpected.

73
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,590
It says this is probably something we're right now I expect you're kind of scratching your head and

74
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,770
saying this kind of seems arbitrary and strange like what's with the name of the mutation.

75
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,880
Why am I passing in arguments right here.

76
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,170
Again you want to be thinking of this thing as being a function of sorts.

77
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,420
So this is like the name of the function and this is the same arguments you are passing into the function

78
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,480
and it's going to customize the body of the function or the body of the mutation down here.

79
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,780
So let's talk a little bit about the arguments that we pass in.

80
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:21,080
The first thing I want to point out is that the argument list in here has a very different format a

81
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,930
very different syntax than what we're used to with the argument list that we've previously had inside

82
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,520
the mutation.

83
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,810
We first list out dollar sign and then title that is the name of the parameter or the name of the argument

84
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,440
that has been passed into this mutation.

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,410
We then place a colon and then the type that that parameter is coming in as.

86
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,220
So for a title I really expect that to be a string.

87
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,480
So I'm going to annotate it as being a string to let everybody know hey if you call this mutation and

88
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:01,710
you pass in a title I expect it to be a string once we call this mutation and pass in a title.

89
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:08,100
We then have access to the dollar sign title variable inside of the mutation body.

90
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,990
So anywhere inside this mutation we can now refer to dollar sign title and it will be a direct reference

91
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,050
to the value that we passed into this mutation so we can really think of dollar sign you table excuse

92
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:28,610
me dollar sign title as a variable of sorts that we can refer back to to refer back to it.

93
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,950
We make use to make use of dollar sign title anywhere where we had previously just been passing in a

94
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,310
direct stream.

95
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:41,820
So notice that in the past we said hey that title should be exactly this you know.

96
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:49,040
So the string dog call I'm now saying the title should be whatever was passed in as Dollar Sign title.

97
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,540
So if you really think of dollar sign title as a reference back to the argument that was passed into

98
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,800
the mutation itself the thing that I find very troublesome or very challenging to keep in my mind whenever

99
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,430
I'm writing mutations out is that the kind of order of referring to dollar sign title changes and the

100
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,890
mutation arguments at the very top we say variable name and then type.

101
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,160
But then inside of the mutation body we're saying argument name variable name.

102
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:24,440
So it's changing it's going from being first to second and then the other argument is changing from

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:31,060
being a type to the name of the argument that I'm probably ranting here a little bit.

104
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,590
But you know as you can tell for me personally this is a little bit of a rough point.

105
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:42,350
So I really like to have a little bit of a pneumonic just remember first sign type name Dollar Sign

106
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,280
Dollar Sign type name Dollar Sign Dollar Sign type name dollar sign.

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,740
Keep that in your head and you'll generally do pretty well.

108
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,390
The other point that is a little bit challenging here is that graphical tool graphical doesn't give

109
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,070
you a lot of auto completion help in here which is a little bit of a pain as well.

110
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,720
But you know we can get through it.

111
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,560
OK.

112
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,400
So let's modify our mutation make use of this alternative syntax we'll say add song dollar sign type

113
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:19,840
and then inside of the mutation variable name Dollar Sign like so.

114
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:26,030
So now if we run this query we don't really get any argument at all.

115
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:34,440
We passed in a title of no like we had undefined title I didn't define a variable of title.

116
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,140
And so when I get a response back I get a title of No.

117
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:43,310
Because I did not pass in a title there is no validation on the title however like I didn't add any

118
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,420
validation on the back end to say you must provide a title.

119
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,370
So the record is still successfully created and but it has a title of no which is definitely probably

120
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,520
something I don't want to have in my application.

121
00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:02,180
So I think that will probably end up going back over to Mungo in lab and clean up that record back inside

122
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,630
of my lyrical D-B dashboard.

123
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,070
Here's my dashboard right here.

124
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,060
I can find my songs collection.

125
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,790
And then I can delete the record that I just created that does not have a title associated with it.

126
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,900
And I can do so by clicking the delete button on the right hand side.

127
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,140
So there's that one without the title and I'll go ahead and delete it.

128
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:24,870
OK.

129
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,420
So back to normal there.

130
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:32,330
So let's now figure out how we use graph code to define a query variable that can be used inside of

131
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,230
the actual mutation inside of here.

132
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,830
We're going to write out what looks like an object that's going to define all the query variables that

133
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,250
we make use of inside of this mutation.

134
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,080
So I'm going to say title and this will be the title of my new song which will be sprite.

135
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,390
First coke.

136
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,110
I am not a good artist.

137
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,980
All I can say is Shrivers coke.

138
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,830
OK.

139
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,140
Now we can run this.

140
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,930
And you'll notice that the title has properly been sent into the mutation.

141
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,540
So whenever you create a mutation that refers to some Querrey variable graphical is going to look at

142
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
the defined curve variables.

143
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:16,490
It's going to take any defined Kuri variable that matches up with the name inside of here and it's going

144
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,350
to take the value and push it in as the value of dollar sign title.

145
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,900
The real big thing to keep in mind is that when we're defining queery variables inside of graphical

146
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,880
we do not use the dollar sign.

147
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,780
So if you put in the dollar sign you're going to get a big error message.

148
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,240
It will place the dollar sign in there for you.

149
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,730
So just the name of the query variable without the dollar sign.

150
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,160
And you should be good to go.

151
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,470
Oh OK.

152
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,630
I know this section has been very long and I've really ranted on a little bit about mutations and query

153
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:50,540
variables but again this whole syntax up here is it really feels a little bit arbitrary.

154
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,010
It doesn't feel that great.

155
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,320
So I want to make sure it's really clear the order in which we're defining these arguments.

156
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,520
I feel like we've got a good solution here for figuring out how to pass in some outside data into nutation

157
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,910
but only inside of graphical.

158
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:13,580
We really have not yet addressed the problem of how we get some information from the component into

159
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,990
our mutation.

160
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,330
So let's take a quick break.

161
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:23,570
We're going to come back and see if we can't figure out how to somehow get data from our reata component

162
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,940
into our mutation by using that query variable system.

163
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,110
So let's take care of that in the next section.
