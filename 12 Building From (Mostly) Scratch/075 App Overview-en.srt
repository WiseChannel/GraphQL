1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,150
In this course we've gone through one application where we focused on the back end one application where

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,700
we focused on the front end and now we're going to focus on an app where we are concerned with the entire

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,110
full stack.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,620
So everything from the back end database all the way to the front end.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,380
We're where we're going to write out our Riak J.S. components and associated queries.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,050
So let's talk a little bit about the project that we're going to start working on in this section.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,660
First we'll start by looking at a mockup for the app that we're going to be building.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,370
So for this last application or I should say this next application that we're going to be working on

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,830
we're going to be working on an application using authentication with graft.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,410
So we've already had a lot of content where we've kind of figured out how to associate data sitting

11
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,680
in our database with our graph queries but that's not really enough to build a full application right.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,420
That's not enough to build a production application for a real production application.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,480
We need to have a reasonable idea of how to authenticate our users and especially in the context of

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,980
graft Well we need to understand how we tie our authentication system with our graph.

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:16,800
Aquarius because a extremely common case and we'll talk about this in great detail is figuring out exactly

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,350
how to best restrict the amount of data that a user can feed that a user can see inside of our application.

17
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,110
But again we'll talk about that at great length.

18
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,320
Those continue looking through of our mockups just a little bit.

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,110
We're going to go through all the different pages that our application is going to have on the front

20
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:38,570
and side and then we'll talk about a couple of the challenges associated with this project.

21
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,490
So when the user first comes to our application I want them to see a landing page of some sort.

22
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,960
So they should in theory not be logged in right now.

23
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:53,130
When they first land on our landing page in the header they should see two buttons that say sign up

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,750
and sign in where a user can create account or sign into an account that already exists.

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,760
Assuming that they click on sign up.

26
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,880
I bet you can guess what's going to happen.

27
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,940
We're going to take them to a form and same thing if they click sign in.

28
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,080
So for both sign up and sign in.

29
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,180
I want the user to see a form appear on the screen.

30
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,680
Now these forms are here.

31
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,720
Yeah they look pretty straightforward and they look awfully similar to the forms we've already put together.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,850
But there are some big differences this time around with the forms that we're looking at here most decidedly

33
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,920
in when we start thinking about validation of inputs.

34
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,730
So in the previous forms we put together we pretty much just always assume that the user was going to

35
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,580
be giving us valid inputs and we did absolutely no error checking or any validation of the input that

36
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,030
we got from the user.

37
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:50,160
But this time around in the case of both Sign-Up and sign in this email and password inputs definitely

38
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,540
have to be validated in some fashion.

39
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,590
So we have to make sure that the users and in say a valid email address and then that e-mail address

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,460
exists inside our database.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,520
If they're trying to sign in or to make sure that that e-mail address is not already in use if they're

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,300
trying to sign up then we have to make sure that they entered the correct password.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,130
If they're attempting to sign in so there's a lot of validation associated with these forms that we

44
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:22,370
have not yet addressed and the pass if we continue looking at some of the other markups on here after

45
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,990
a user successfully signs up or signs then we'll consider them to be authenticated in some fashion.

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,700
And I want to show them a log in page basically some page that says just Hey welcome back.

47
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,980
So we're not going to focus quite so much on the graph.

48
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,790
Q Well fancy data fetching and relationships and all that kind of stuff around the focus on this application

49
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,710
we're making is way more on the authentication side of things.

50
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,670
OK.

51
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:54,280
So in general standard authentication and all the problems associated with it but we're going to tackle

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,610
all this from a graft standpoint and we're going to see that there's a lot of very interesting ideas

53
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,950
or a lot of interesting problems that we have to solve as we go through this application.

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,310
So let's take a quick break and we're going to come back and talk about some of the problems and challenges

55
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,380
that are associated with this application.

56
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,160
So see you in just a second.
