1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,810
We you spent a lot of time talking about different approaches of handling authentication with graphics.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,710
Well at the end of the day we agreed that going with a couple approach would probably make more sense

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,850
for the app that we're going to work on right now because I think it's just slightly more technically

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,190
challenging and I would like to show you an example of some of the really complex sides of graft.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,280
Well as opposed to kinda copping out and saying oh yeah handling authentication separately is the best

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,110
way to go.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,450
And we don't really get to experience tying authentication with graphics at all.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,580
OK.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,900
So in this section we're going talk a little bit about the different types and mutations that I think

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,970
that we'll need for application and then we'll start working on the first mutation or type or whatever

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,830
we decide we need to make.

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,080
There is one less piece of set up I want to take care of.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:55,560
However recall that inside of our project if we open up our server server got G-S file we have to get

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,490
a mongo lab instance to throw in here.

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,120
So I want to do that sign up piece really quick or make that new database piece really quick and then

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,550
we can move onto the authentication stuff and we won't have to worry about any set up code and anything

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,830
like that in the future.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,010
So let's open up Mongul lab inside of our browser and we're going to get a new you or else for a longer

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:25,830
instance it's going to navigate to Mungo lab dot com or just in lab it redirects there anyways and I'm

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,970
going to create a new Mongo D-B deployment.

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,390
Once a year we've gone through these settings before I want to make sure that I have AWOS selected I'm

22
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,740
going to make sure that my region is Amazon US East no matter where you live in the in the world I need

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,450
make sure I have that selected.

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,220
We'll go to a single node and then we'll select the free sandbox and we can scroll all the way down

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,110
to the bottom.

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,690
Give it a database name.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:59,910
I need to call my database just off short for authentication and then I'll create the new deployment.

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,510
And as usual this is usually pretty darn fast.

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,020
And Rigaud it looks good.

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,200
So we can open up the new database that was just created

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,130
and then grab the new user Numi users Tabaret here.

32
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:23,210
So let's make our new user to access the database mislike the users tab and then the add database user

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,920
button.

34
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,430
And then again we need to turn a little bit of configuration here so I'm going to go with my tried and

35
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:35,010
true Steven and password and I'm going to make sure that this is not a read only user.

36
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,500
So that is not going to be selected Well click Create

37
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,190
cool.

38
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,720
Here's my new user.

39
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,800
And then I can zoom in here for just a second.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,550
Grab the database.

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,670
You or I right at the top if I can select it.

42
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,710
There we go.

43
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:03,190
I'm going to copy it and we'll flip back over to our code editor find the Mungo you are i variable inside

44
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,720
of the server J file.

45
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,830
I'm going to paste it in and make sure that I replace the DV user and D-B password with my entered username

46
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,900
and password that I just created.

47
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,490
Cool.

48
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,360
Looks good.

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,140
We've got our you are for our Mongo lab instance.

50
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,560
OK.

51
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,870
Let's take a quick break come back and talk about the queries and mutations that we're going to need

52
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,480
inside of our application.
