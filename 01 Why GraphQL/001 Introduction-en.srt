Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,940
My name is Stephen Greider and I am here to teach you everything that I know about graft Cuil and react

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,370
before we get started with any code.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,410
I want to cover a couple of frequently asked questions about this course and give you a better idea

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,920
of how it's structured.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,230
First I want to tell you a little bit more about what we're going to be covering in the coming sections.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,250
We're first going to be discussing why Graf QOL exists.

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:34,500
Gruffed QSL has the interesting distinction of being a technology where it's very important to understand

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,120
what problem it intends to solve.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,230
Once you understand what graft to all attempts to solve understanding it starts to become a lot easier

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,540
because you're able to frame all the different challenges of the framework into understanding why we're

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,680
using it in the first place.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,550
After we talk a little bit about what graph irks me why graph exists.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,570
We'll talk a little bit about exactly what it is.

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,780
So what is graph.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,790
Q Well if it is meant to solve some existing problems how is it going to solve it.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,650
What does it really do for us.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,510
Finally we'll talk about how we use craft Cuil.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,380
So how do we make use of graphics.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,540
Well on our back end applications and how do we actually wire that up to our re-act front end.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,730
So this last step right here of course can be the very longest section of the course and will be the

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,790
bulk of everything that we cover.

23
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,890
Now before we get started anything else just one last quick slide a couple of frequently asked questions

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,670
and answers that I get throughout all of my different courses.

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,970
First I use balsamic mockups to create all the different diagrams that you'll be looking at inside this

26
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,560
course there.

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,690
I've used many different types of diagram tools.

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,740
I found balsamic has the best mix of being easy to use and quick to put diagrams together but the diagrams

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,100
that are generated also look really nice which is a nice little benefit.

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,160
Next I use ATOM for my code editor.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,530
You're free to use absolutely any code editor that you like.

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,000
There is absolutely no requirement to use Adam.

33
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,470
You can use sublime web storm textedit anything you want totally up to you.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,460
Finally for my terminal I make use of I term with Z shell.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,590
So if you want to get the same looking command prompt that I do you can grab I'd term and Z shell and

36
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,300
you'll get something right out of the box.

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,970
Looks pretty much identical to what I use.

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:28,950
OK.

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
So that's it with frequently asked questions.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,260
Let's get started with the real interesting content in the next section.
