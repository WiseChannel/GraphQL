1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,870
Let's take a quick break from the graph Cuil and Appollo side of our application by addressing these

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,040
issues that we have in here.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,560
So I want to make sure that the icon itself moves over to the far right hand side of every single row

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,620
and then I would also really like it if instead of this kind of text cursor that I did while hovering

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,590
over an icon I'd be really happy if I could have a nice kind of pointer finger there instead just make

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,020
sure that users are clear that they can click on this icon to do something.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,990
So let's add a little bit of CSSA to address this inside of my code editor.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,340
I'm going to find this style folder inside of the client directory and then open up the style Dotsie

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:47,430
SS file inside if you're going to add two selectors and just a handful of rules the first selector that

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,720
will add is collection item with the class name.

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,450
So use a dot in front of it.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,250
So this is the individual row for each song.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,410
I'm going to tell the row that it should use a display of flaks.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:08,340
So this is enabling the flex box system and then I will also assign the justified content property and

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,390
assign it space between the space between ruler right here is going to make sure that all of the content

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,490
inside of the collection item maximizes the space between each item.

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,160
So I've got currently the song title and the icon.

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,010
Just take a look.

19
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,930
The song title and the icon.

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,340
So the space between rule is going to make sure that there is the maximum amount of distance between

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,880
those two items.

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,520
Let's refresh the page and see what it looks like.

23
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,830
Oh one step.

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,380
We've got one quick step.

25
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,580
The last one quick step I forgot.

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,480
We need to make sure that we import the style that CSSA file somewhere into our project.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,560
I'm going to open up my index file and we will import the CSSA file.

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,540
At the very top so we can just say import and we don't have to name the import we don't have to assign

29
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,160
it to a variable so we can just pass it the path to the file directly.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,330
So we'll say go into the style file and then find style dots.

31
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,590
SS OK.

32
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,010
Now we can do that really fresh and see it update on the screen.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,170
So now all refresh and.

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,600
OK.

35
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,860
That looks way better.

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,390
Now the other thing I want to take care of is making sure we get the nice cursor icon.

37
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:30,180
So back inside of the style sheet file I will add on the rule or the selector excuse me material icons

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,660
and then to get the nighest kind of finger pointer of course your cursor and say cursor with a property

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,630
of pointer like so.

40
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,330
So now let's refresh this again.

41
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,560
And whenever I mouseover I get that nice kind of finger look in point thing that makes it really clear

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,490
that a user can click on the trash can to delete an individual song soldierly yoga Express and Dog Night

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,600
and OK.

44
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,940
Yeah that's definitely work in just the way we expect.

45
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,230
This is working pretty well.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,520
Let's get back to the react engraft you will side of things in the next section.
