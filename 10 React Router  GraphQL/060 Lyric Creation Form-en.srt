1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,850
Let's get started with the lyric create form that we're going to place into the song detail component

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,700
the lyric create form is going to be pretty straightforward just the label.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,150
And then a text input to receive some new lyric to associate with the given song that we're looking

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,690
at.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,420
And in there presumably we're going to call a mutation to create the lyric and save it to the song.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,650
So let's go to saut will first create the component and just make sure that we can get it to show up

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,190
on the song detail page.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:34,620
So back in my code editor you find my component's directory and I'll make a new file for this lyric

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,340
create component now inside of here.

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,380
I definitely expect to have to make use of component level States because we are working with a text

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,590
input and I want that to be a controlled form input.

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,550
So I'm definitely gonna make this a class based component.

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,640
And I will put down a little bit of boilerplate for our component

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:12,650
will define the render method right now and all place probably just a div and a form tag inside of it.

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,680
But you know what Actually now I think about it I don't think that we're showing anything besides the

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,190
form inside this component.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,800
So let's just go with the form What the heck will plays just the form inside this thing

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:34,830
will give the form a label of add a lyric and an input

19
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,980
no and change just yet.

20
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,560
Let's just focus on the input like so.

21
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,150
And I think that's a good start.

22
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:49,130
Let's also put the export default statement at the bottom like so.

23
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:49,870
OK.

24
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,810
I think that we got enough to at least get this on the screen and make sure that everything's working

25
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,040
pretty well.

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,360
Now I want to show the lyric creation form only when a user is looking at a particular song.

27
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,020
So I think that the song detailed component is a great place to anchor this thing.

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,510
So inside of the song detail I'm going to import the component that we just created.

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:20,000
So lyric creates from lyric create Doo-Wops the spelling on lyric by the way I just want to throw that

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,550
out there.

31
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,920
Sometimes tricky word.

32
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,650
You can easily make a quick typo on that.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,460
So do watch the spelling of lyric now will place the lyric create component inside of your so lyric

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,940
create like so cool.

35
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,050
Let's flip over to the browser and just make sure we can use that form to show up on the screen without

36
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,440
any error message.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,150
OK so here's the form to create a new lyric.

38
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,950
If you do not see the form appear on screen or if you see any error messages inside of your console

39
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,570
remember best place to check is to look at your terminal and see if you have any typos.

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,150
So this looks good.

41
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,980
It's definitely a good start.

42
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,030
Let's take a quick break and then come back in the next section and think a little bit about the work

43
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,710
that we're going to have to do inside of Llyr create to serve to associate a lyric with a given song.

44
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,780
So let's take a quick break and then tackle that in the next section.
