1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,590
Our application is looking pretty good.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,490
And I think there's just one last big part that we have to do every single letter that we have should

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,350
have the ability to like it.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,200
So a user should have some button over here where they can click to like an individual lyric let's look

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,950
back at our mock up just to make sure that we're still on the same page.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,080
So here is my lyric list component and we're saying that every single lyric should have a big thumbs

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,060
up where the user can click.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,270
So let's start taking care of that inside of this section.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,210
The path we're tackling this will be just as we've done in the past.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,630
We're talking about modifying or updating a piece of data on our back and so we immediately want to

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,270
start thinking nutation we want to mutate the data on our backend.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,850
So we're going to first pleasurably place the eye on here probably place an event handler on it and

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,210
then we will flip over to graphical and start working on writing out the mutation inside of graphical.

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,040
So let's get started.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,740
I'm going to flip over first to my code editor and find my lyric list component.

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,110
Here it is right here.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:13,160
So my goal is to show a icon inside of the slide that is being rendered for each lyric.

18
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,520
We've done lyrics set and we've done icons several times in this application now.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,240
So I'm going to add on a little icon in here that will show the lyric for us.

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,050
I keep saying lyrics that will show the icon for us excuse me in a place my I'd tag I'm going to give

21
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:41,370
it a class name of material icons and then the icon name I want to make use of is thumb up again.

22
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,590
Remember that the material icons library that we're making use of expects us to put the name of the

23
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,210
icon that we want right here.

24
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,460
I am not arbitrarily making up the name of the icon.

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,490
This is coming from a list of different icons that are available.

26
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,620
So now we can attach an event handler to this right here and whenever a user clicks on it it will call

27
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,630
our mutation just give myself a little bit more space.

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,670
I'm going to New Line the list of props like so

29
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,030
I know that's a little bit ugly.

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,410
But again I'm kind of a space constrained here.

31
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,710
If you want to you can probably keep a lot of this on a single line yourself.

32
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,840
So add on our event handler on click and the thing to keep in mind here is that we're in the same situation

33
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,870
as we were previously with our list of songs.

34
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,770
So the unclick handler that we're going to call needs to know about the ID of the lyric that we're trying

35
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,840
to like.

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:45,210
So rather than just saying oh yeah call this dot on like stop buying this or something like that.

37
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,950
We're going to use an arrow function where we can pass in the I.D. of the like.

38
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,230
That works to me the lyric that we're trying to like into the function.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,540
So we're going to use an arrow function and we'll say this dot on like it will pass in the ID of the

40
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,230
lyric that we're trying to make use of.

41
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,580
So we now need to define the event handler on light come up and define it up here.

42
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,200
I'll say on light it's going to be called with the lyric ID.

43
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,020
And OK I think that's pretty good right now.

44
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,950
I'm going to add in just to console log.

45
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,350
Make sure everything is working the way we expect.

46
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,470
I'll flip back over to my code editor.

47
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,150
I'm going to refresh the application.

48
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,160
It looks like it's OK it's definitely looking pretty good right now.

49
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,480
That's nice.

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,070
I'll click on the thing and all right.

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,730
Looks like we're definitely getting the ID of the lyric that we're clicking on.

52
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,900
Looks like a pretty good place to take a quick pause because mutation that we're going to deal with

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,660
here is going to be a little bit more complex than you might think.

54
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,160
So let's take a quick break come back and start working on the mutation side of graphical.
