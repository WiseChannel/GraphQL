1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,670
Now that our user has the ability to add lyrics to a song we need to start thinking about showing a

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,550
list of all the different lyrics that are associated with the song right here.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,020
So as a reminder we basically want to show an interface kind of like this right here where a user should

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,210
be able to see a list of all the different lyrics.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,390
They should see the content of the lyric off to the left hand side and then a like button on the right

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,010
hand side.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,630
That people can click to like that given song and this is all going to be contained within the lyric

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,220
list component.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,590
So you might be looking at this thing right here and thinking Steven Oh my gosh you're kidding me.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,410
We really just did this list building stuff over and Song Index.

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,440
What possible new stuff can we possibly learn inside of building another list like this.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,590
Well just just hold on there is still on there.

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,810
You'd be very surprised but we are going to run into several very big issues around big building this

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,590
list right here.

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,660
So even though it looks nearly identical to the one that we've already done I guarantee you there's

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,520
going to be some really interesting and challenging gotchas that come up around building this list.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,670
So stick around.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,610
We are going to build this list and we're going to tackle each one of these challenges.

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,120
Let's get started by working on the lyric list component and just doing some scaffolding of the thing

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,160
as a re-act component.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,130
So we'll get started by opening up our code editor and creating a new component inside of our components

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:37,520
directory called lyric list and inside of here I'll import react.

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,600
I am going to make this a class based component because it will be a little bit more complicated and

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,170
it's going to be very nice to have some helper methods available rather than using a functional component.

25
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,090
So import that from reacts like so.

26
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,890
And we'll make our lyric list.

27
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:02,280
It's going to extend component of put in my render method right now.

28
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,690
And I expect this thing to really just be showing a list of items.

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,230
So I'm just going to place a UL in here for right now.

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,080
I'll say yeah give me a UL or give it the text lyric list.

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,850
Just put something on the screen and then at the bottom you know literary classic export default lyric

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,720
list.

33
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,310
OK.

34
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,320
So this is looking pretty reasonal right now.

35
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:32,560
I want to hook this thing up to the parent component of song detail so some detail is the overall container

36
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,740
for both lyric list and lyric create.

37
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,110
So we're going to flip back over to our song detail component we will import the lyric list that we

38
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,830
just created

39
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,730
import from lyric list like so.

40
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,530
And we'll make a list of or excuse me I'll make use of the lyric list inside of this guy right here.

41
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,500
So we'll scroll down just a little bit.

42
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,170
And I think just right below the age three but above the lyric creation form is probably a very appropriate

43
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,030
location for this element.

44
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,290
So we'll display the lyric list right here.

45
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,480
OK.

46
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,510
So looking good lookin reasonable.

47
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,270
Let's refresh our page and just make sure everything's working the way we expect.

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,780
You know Larry CList very good.

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,840
OK.

50
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,140
Let's take a quick break and then come back and start looking at some of the different challenges that

51
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,620
we're going to have with this lyric list component.
