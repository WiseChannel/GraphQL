1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,950
We've now got a server that is a little bit more development friendly.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,090
So I think it's time to move back over to our application and work on a little bit more logic around

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,900
handling queries.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,990
The next part of the application that we're going to be working on is to hook up we're leading a company

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,460
to a user.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,860
So we're going to introduce the idea of a company and we're going to relate it to a user.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,050
As a reminder.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,980
We're going to see that every company has an ID a name and a description and then we're going to relate

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,390
each company to a particular user by adding a company ID property to a particular user.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,220
So if we have a company with ID of one maybe some user has a company ID one and we would know that that

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,730
particular user is related to that particular company.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,170
Once we actually write out the data it will be a little bit more obvious how this relationship works.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,760
So lets get to it and we'll see how it goes.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,930
Once we can test it inside of our browser.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,840
So back over my code editor I'm going to find my DVDs on file.

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,990
So I'll start off by adding a couple of companies in here so we have a couple of companies to kind of

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,190
play around with.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,490
Then we'll go back to our schema file and create a new company type just like we created our user type

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,440
previously.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:21,330
I'm going to add in a new company's key and we'll see that we just have two companies will give the

21
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,640
first one an ID of one a name.

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,360
How about Apple and a description of iPhone.

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:43,820
I mean that works then for the second company we'll give them an ID of two a name of Google and description

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,880
of search like some do remind do remember that this is old Jason that we're writing here so make sure

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,050
that you are using double quotes for both the keys and values.

26
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,260
And again make sure you're using double quotes not single quotes.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
So we've got two companies in here now.

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,540
I'm going to add one more user and then we'll set up the relationship between all of our companies in

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,620
all of our users.

30
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,680
I want to add in a another user here just so that will have at least one company that has two users

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,270
who belong to it because that's going to be a little bit of an interesting problem when we have to deal

32
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,660
with that.

33
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,310
Over on the graphical side.

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,250
So I'm going to duplicate one of my users I'm going to make sure I change their ID and their first name

35
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:36,310
and then I'm going to relate my users with a particular company by adding in the company ID property

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,820
like so.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:51,630
So I mean to say that Bill maybe he works at Apple will say maybe Alex works at Google and I think maybe

38
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,850
Nick will just work at Google as well.

39
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,770
So both Alex and Nick have a company ID of to do make sure that youve got an ID of capital.

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,250
I lowercase D.

41
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,920
Thats really important for when we start to play with this data inside of our Jason server.

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,810
Speaking of which let's test this out let's open up our Jason server inside the browser and look at

43
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,560
how we can play with these companies and these users and relate the two of them together.

44
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:25,980
It's going to open up my browser I mean open a new tab and I'll go straight over to localhost 3000 slash

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,100
users.

46
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,130
So this is our list of users right.

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,750
We know that.

48
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,920
Great now that we've added in the top level key of companies we can also go to slash companies.

49
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,450
And here is Apple and Google are two companies that we just added all the same restful Conventions apply

50
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,120
on here as well so we can go to companies slashed one and get the company with ID of one in here as

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,940
well so its all work in the same way that we saw with users previously.

52
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,820
Now the real question how do we get Jason Serwer to tell us all the users who work at company with ID

53
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,640
one.

54
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:12,480
Well because we added that company ID key to the users object that automatically sets up a relationship

55
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:19,940
behind the scenes with JS on server so we can go to slash companies slash 1 slash users.

56
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,130
And that will give me all the users who work at company one.

57
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,460
I could go to a company to slash users and now I got everyone who is working at a company with ID too.

58
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,940
So again that relationship right here up in the world is restful relation or this wrestle convention

59
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:42,300
that were seen up here it is all being done behind the scenes by Jesus on server solely because we set

60
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,280
up these company IDs on here.

61
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,960
So its a really fantastic feature.

62
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,110
JS on server.

63
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,930
Honestly I just can't rave enough about Jason so I really like it it's a fantastic little project for

64
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,110
and you need to put together some mock data.

65
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,840
OK but anyways enough for me enough for me talking about Jason silver.

66
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,620
Let's look back over toward schema file and we're going to work on adding in the new company type inside

67
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,140
of here in the next section so we'll take a quick break come back and put together our company type.
