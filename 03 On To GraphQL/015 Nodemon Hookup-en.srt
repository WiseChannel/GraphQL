1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,270
We've really been hammering through a graph Kulick quite quickly at this point.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,410
So I want to take a moment to just take a short break from anything graphically related and do a little

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:16,010
bit of maintenance on our server right now whenever we change our server code we have to manually stop

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,130
and restart our server backup.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,770
This is really annoying to have to do and it's really not uncommon to forget to restart the server altogether

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,910
which of course leads to errors.

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:33,170
So to solve this we're going to hook up a little package called node Mohn to our server node one's purpose

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,900
is to watch over all of our project files and automatically restart the server whenever our project

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,210
code changes.

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:47,000
So this is really just done to help ensure that our server is always running the latest code hooking

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,350
up gnomon is pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,150
All we have to do is install it as a dependency so that the command line will run NPM install dust ash

13
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,090
saves Node 1 after this is installed.

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:07,690
We'll make a separate script inside of our package that is on file to start our server up using gnomon.

15
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,060
So let's change over to our code editor.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,080
I'm going to find my package got some file and under the script section I'm going to make a new script

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:27,550
called Dev and whenever the devs script is executed we'll run node Mohn server dot J J.S. like so cool.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,180
So now we can flip back over toward terminal.

19
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,940
We can start up our server now by running NPM run dev.

20
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,330
We really get a little bit of a pop up from gnomon and it says hey OK I'm watching all the files inside

21
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,970
of your current working directory.

22
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,300
It's any file changes.

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,010
The server will automatically be restarted as well.

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,190
So just as a quick little test I'm going to come into my schema file and it's going to add in a little

25
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,590
comment symbol right here.

26
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,970
I can save it and automatically get the restart.

27
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,730
I'm also going to clean up that comment.

28
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,600
So it's not left in there and we get the restarted again.

29
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,100
Perfect.

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,070
Just so we wanted.

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,830
So now we do not need to research a server at any point in time.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,250
Let's continue on the next section and start working on our next query.
