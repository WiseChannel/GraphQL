1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,090
In the last section we recognize that the dashboard component that we just created is not really properly

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,290
tracking whether or not we are currently signed into the application.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,550
So even though I'm on the dashboard route right now I'm also not signed in which is definitely not the

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,610
intent here.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,670
So to make sure that we've got a good idea of how we expect authentication to work in our app Let's

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,630
take a look at a quick diagram here.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,910
So on the left hand side we have a list of the two different components that we currently have where

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,090
anyone can go regardless of whether or not they are currently authenticated.

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,460
And of course that's going to be the log in form and the sign up form.

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,550
On the flip side is a list of components where only authenticated users can go after they have signed

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,250
into our application.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,590
We've got a dashboard component and then just I'm totally making these up.

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,100
I'm just throwing out a example here we don't actually have these components.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,760
I'm just saying for example we might also have an account settings page and a profile page where a user

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,910
can only go if they are authenticated inside of our application.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,390
So I mean to show you with this diagram right here is that we might have several different components

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,580
inside of our application that need to be aware of the user's authentication status.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,610
So several different routes need to make sure that the user is authenticated before they can actually

19
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,260
visit that component.

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,660
All three of these.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,580
So what that means to me or that kind of tells me personally is that I don't want to tie any authentication

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,330
specific logic to any individual component because I don't want to have to copy paste a bunch of logic

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:39,480
around from the dashboard to the account settings to the profile page all deciding whether or not the

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,790
user needs to be redirected based on their current authentication status.

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,430
Instead I want to take all that code that's going to be all about figuring out the user's current authentication

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,850
state and I want to stuff it in one centralized location and then reuse it through these three different

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,120
components right here.

28
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,780
So I want to have some reusable amount of code that determines what to do based on the user's authentication

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:12,570
status to handle reusable code like this inside of re-act the classic go to solution is a higher order

30
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,140
component or an agency or a hawk.

31
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,900
So that's what we're going to be use here using to handle authentication between different components

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,880
inside of our application that all need to make sure that the user is authenticated before they can

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,840
visit that particular component.

34
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:35,170
So we're going to create something called the require off higher order component.

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,230
Now if you're not familiar with higher order components that's OK.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,770
I'm not going to go into them in great detail just because this is kind of getting pretty off topic

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,820
from the graphical world.

38
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,340
So let's take a quick break.

39
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,340
We'll come back in the next section and we'll start working on this.

40
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,580
Required off higher order component which will be responsible for deciding whether or not the user needs

41
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,660
to be redirected to the log in page depending on their current authentication status.

42
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,560
So to take care of that in the next section.
