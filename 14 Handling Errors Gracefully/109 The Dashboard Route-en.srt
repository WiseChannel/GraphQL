1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,940
We've got to redirect over to the dashboard route put together but we don't yet have a component that

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,880
is meant to display whenever we go to the dashboard route.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,700
So let's make a new dashboard component and then hook it up inside of our router to change back over

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,100
to my code editor and inside the components directory will make a new file.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,550
I will just call this one dashboard Don.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,680
Yes.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,330
We're not going to put a tremendous amount of logic into this dashboard component.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,600
I really just want to have something that says hey you're at the dashboard you should only see this

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,390
if you're currently signed in.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,410
So I don't think we need to make a class based component here.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,890
I think we can just make a functional component and call it good at that at the top.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:50,100
We'll import react from react and then will immediately make our component function and export it style

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,560
up the font size as well just a little bit and inside of it.

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:00,960
Hey let's just return a div that says you are logged in.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,210
Looks good.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,360
This is pretty much all we need.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,980
Again I just want something to show hey you are considered to be logged in at this point in time so

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,750
we don't get that big error message after we sign in and get redirected over to the dashboard route.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,590
So now we can hook this up inside of our router file inside of the index not just file in our client

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,640
directory.

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,220
Let's import the dashboard component that we just created.

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,930
Like so and then we can add another route to our router file.

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,130
Or excuse me our route definition just a little bit lower down side the file.

24
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,050
So here's the three different routes that we have right now.

25
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,240
I'll add on one more route inside of here.

26
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:50,300
So whenever someone goes to that route dashboard or that path dashboard will show that the dashboard

27
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,370
component at those Coosa test real quick.

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,960
I definitely expect this to just work right out of the box.

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,290
We're not doing anything too crazy here just yet.

30
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,150
So I'm going to refresh the page.

31
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,480
Notice that I am currently on the route slash dashboard.

32
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,350
And so after I refreshed I successfully see on the screen you are logged in.

33
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,330
Fantastic.

34
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,980
One quick thing however you'll notice that on the header right here I have the log out button.

35
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,900
So definitely means yes I'm currently logged in.

36
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,610
Let's try logging out real quick.

37
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,100
So get to log out.

38
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:32,500
You'll notice that I'm still on the dashboard route here and if I refresh I can still see the dashboard

39
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,920
route and it still says hey you're logged in.

40
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,790
But clearly the header is reflecting.

41
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,360
No that's not the case I'm not actually logged in at this point in time.

42
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,600
So we need to do something at least somewhere plus some amount of logic to say hey if the user is trying

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,510
to get to the dashboard page let's make sure that they actually are logged in and then we also need

44
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:58,000
to make sure that after the user signs out like when they click log out on the header.

45
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,340
If they're currently on the dashboard route we need to make sure that we dump them back to the log in

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,940
page or some something that says at least Hey you're not logged out.

47
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,290
We need to redirect you away from the dashboard.

48
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,620
So we clearly do not have that piece of logic yet inside of our application.

49
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,090
Let's take a quick break and we're going come back and discuss exactly how we're going to add this logic

50
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,120
to make sure that we redirect the user after they sign out of our application.
