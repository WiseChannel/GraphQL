1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,730
There's just one less thing that we have to do before we started dressing the client side of our application

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,200
and that's to set up a new Mongo DB database hosted remotely by Monga lab or in lab.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,810
In this section we're going to create that Mongo D-B instance get a connection you or I which is a address

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,610
to the Mongo D-B instance that has been created for us and then we'll be able to connect to that remote

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,730
database to save all the data that we're going to generate inside of our application.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,150
So let's get started.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,930
We're going to open up our browser and navigate to in lab dot com.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:42,150
So a new browser in lab dot com like so now once here you'll notice the sign up and logging buttons

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,840
on the top right hand side.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,460
I already have an account can go ahead and log in.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,050
I do encourage you to create a new account when you create your new account.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,400
Do make sure that use a valid email address one that you actually have access to before you can create

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,870
any database there are going to prompt you to verify your e-mail address.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,620
So if you give them a fake one you're going to run into some issues.

15
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,670
So again I already have an account some can go ahead and log in as a reminder.

16
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,900
The only reason that we are using in lab here rather than setting up a local database on our own machine

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,570
is just to avoid doing any type of set up on our local machine.

18
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,620
We're doing development with Mongo D-B.

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,890
It is absolutely okay and appropriate to use a hosted in lab instance.

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,820
And as a matter of fact if you end up going over to AWOS for your hosting chances are you might make

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,260
use of in lab anyways.

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,170
So once I'm signed in I'm going to find the create new button on the top right hand side to create a

23
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,090
new database.

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,130
Now on the page that comes up you're going to see a couple settings on the top of the page.

25
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,710
First off is the cloud provider and then some plan details on the cloud provider.

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,720
I'm going to leave it as Amazon Web Services and then you'll notice underneath that is a listed region.

27
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,560
So you might be very tempted to change the region on here to a country that might be a little bit more

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,970
colocated to wherever you are.

29
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:15,900
However as far as I know only Amazon US East offers free instances so I'm going to leave it as Amazon

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,700
US East no matter where you live in the country so or a different country.

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,820
So if you are overseas from the U.S. no matter what.

32
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,930
Just go ahead and leave it as US East then underneath that I'm going to make sure that I select a single

33
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,340
note and in the very top result should be for a sandbox instance which is some shared database or shared

34
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,660
memory and we get half a gigabyte of storage space which is absolutely without a doubt enough for getting

35
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,680
started with the application that we are working with 500 megabytes.

36
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,360
To be honest it is even enough for doing a little hobby application or something where you're just kind

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,520
of testing out and you want to do a deployment and send it off to your friends.

38
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,280
Without a doubt is probably going to be large enough for vast majority of use cases after selecting

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,680
sandbox instance which should be free.

40
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,510
We'll scroll down to the bottom and enter a database name.

41
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:17,760
And for this I'm going to use lyrical D-B like so then we'll go ahead and create the new Mongo DB deployment.

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,460
OK.

43
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,410
So it kicks us back at the central dashboard where I can now see the new database that was just created.

44
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm going to expand the century or just go ahead and click on it and it'll take me into the details

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,780
for the database itself.

46
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,640
Now at the very top you'll see something on here it says to connect to the Mungo's shell and turn this

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,320
command right here.

48
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,770
OK that's fantastic.

49
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,050
We don't want to open up the Mungo's shell.

50
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:50,080
We want to connect via a driver to the database instance using this Mongo D-B you or I.

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,850
So this is really the string that we're looking for right here and I know the text on the screen is

52
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,580
pretty small let's dial it up just a little bit.

53
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,110
So this is the URL or you or I that we're looking for right here.

54
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,010
However you will notice that it says D-B user and divi password in here.

55
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,690
So of course this is saying hey you need to replace D-B user right here NDB password with your username

56
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,900
and password.

57
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:20,080
Now you might be tempted to think oh well that's the data that's the username and password for in lab

58
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,480
dot com.

59
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,710
And that's actually not the case.

60
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,940
It is not your username and password that you just signed up to in love with the DV user NDB password

61
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,470
that you see refer to right there.

62
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:39,330
Is talking about users who are assigned to that database as like a database administrator now by default.

63
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,410
You don't get any users in the database on in lab.

64
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,140
So if I click on the user's tab right here it says none at this time.

65
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:53,100
So to use this you or I right here we have to first add a database user with a username and the password

66
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,140
and then we can make use of that Mongo DB you or I up here.

67
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,980
So we'll click add database user and we get prompted with database username password and confirmed password.

68
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:13,110
So for me I'm really not concerned with the credentials here that much because I personally going to

69
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,150
delete these after I encourage you to use some credentials different than the ones you just use for

70
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,000
the inland dot com just because that's a really good practice to have.

71
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,920
But at the end of the day you just want something that's going to be easy for you to remember.

72
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:32,100
So I've personally just entered a database username of Steven and a database password of Stephen as

73
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,380
well as just my name.

74
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:41,680
So I'll go ahead and create this database user.

75
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,780
And then I should see the new database user appear right here and you'll notice that it does say read

76
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,720
only false which is exactly what we want because this is not a read only user.

77
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,650
It is a user who should have both read and write access to the database.

78
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,600
So now that we created this new user we can make use of the Mongo DB you or I appear so I'll select

79
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,550
you or I can copy it.

80
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,280
Then we'll flip back over toward code editor.

81
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,640
I'm inside my server.

82
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,420
Yes file.

83
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,070
We're going to find that Mongo you are I.S. right here.

84
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,760
Here's the variable declaration.

85
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,090
I'm going to paste it inside of that string like so.

86
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,500
So there is the entire string connecting to my very personal Mongo lab instance again to make sure that

87
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,930
you are creating your actual you know own database here because the one that I just created for the

88
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:38,360
purpose of this video I'm going to delete very soon after finishing all these videos because you know

89
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,760
don't you guys connect into my database that's my database not your database.

90
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,910
Now listen we have to do is replace the D-B user.

91
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,880
So I'm going to take out that entire chunk right there and then put in the username that I just created

92
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,590
in the password for it as well.

93
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,920
So do make sure that you don't have the greater than or less than symbols in here anymore.

94
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:06,800
Those are just there to give you reference as a as a developer as a user of where to enter your username

95
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,150
and password.

96
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:08,970
OK.

97
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,760
So that should be it.

98
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,910
I think we're about ready to do a little test here so I'm going to save.

99
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,580
I will then flip over to my terminal.

100
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,850
I'm inside of my project directory so lyrical graphics.

101
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:28,860
Well that was my project directory and I'm going to start the server up using the NPM run death command.

102
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,470
So we'll start it up.

103
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,540
And my expectation is that it should start up the server and it should also kind of bootstrap the re-act

104
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,880
JSA application as well.

105
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,000
So we got two little messages in there before we saw a big bunch output.

106
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,400
We just seen listening.

107
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,100
Which means that the server the Express server itself started up we should see connected to Mungo lab

108
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,920
instance which means that the database was actually successfully connected to the Mongo left side and

109
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,980
then we see a bunch of output on here for all the web pack stuff that's going on inside of our application.

110
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,110
So all the web PAC related materials.

111
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,040
OK.

112
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,730
This looks good.

113
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,920
The last little bit of testing that we're going to do is to open up our browser and visit local host

114
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,190
4000 just to make sure that everything actually got started up correctly.

115
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,800
So when I go to look at those 4000 I should see lyrical appear on the screen and this is of course also

116
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,220
a graph to Elsevier.

117
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,820
So I should be able to go to localhost 4000 slash graft you well and see graph l pop up as well.

118
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,340
Then test it.

119
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,470
Now do note that one thing I want to mention is when you started up your server if you got a message

120
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:43,350
that said something like Portland use or something about a air address and use all you've got to do

121
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:48,000
is make sure that you go and close the server from the application that we were working on previously

122
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,510
because they are attempting to run in the same port.

123
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:51,920
All right.

124
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,840
I think that we're all set with our initial set up which means we get to do a little bit of work on

125
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,750
exploring the schema that we get in this project and talk a little bit more about how we're going to

126
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,250
approach this project in the next section.
