1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,160
Now that we've got a better idea of all these different technologies and the graphical space let's get

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,410
started on our next project where we're going to start to venture into the front end and build out a

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,590
real web application.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,670
Now before we get started on any project materials I want to give you a brief overview of where we are

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,510
in this course right now.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,080
So in this diagram we were spending everywhere from the front end.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,760
So using re-act using Appollo client all this kind of stuff all the way to the back end where we've

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:38,890
got Express and node and our database so far in our back and side loops so far and our back and side

9
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,310
that's what we just covered in the section we just went through.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,320
So we saw how to use graph Cuil on the server side to put together a graphical application that was

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,480
Section 1.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,020
Now in section 2 we're going to start to concentrate a lot more on the front end instead.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,430
And for this application we are not going to do any work on the backend.

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,430
So I already have a server put together that we're going to clone down and make use of inside of this

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,980
next application.

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:11,840
Do you hear the idea here is that I want you to just focus 100 percent on the front end of our application.

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,770
All of the code in the startup project I already put together is following the exact same conventions

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,100
of what we just went through.

19
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,310
Again I just want you to be able to focus on the front end of this next step we're going to work on

20
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,480
after we are complete with this next application.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,270
We're going to do our last out which will be the entire spectrum the full stack so everything from the

22
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,250
re-act front end all the way to our database on the back end using graph.

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,390
Q Well in all associated technologies.

24
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,750
So again I just wanted to give you a little bit of a preview into what we're going to work around for

25
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,630
the remainder of this course.

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:56,190
So with that in mind our next step is going to be to pull down all the code for the starter projects

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,130
that I have already put together for Section 2.

28
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,770
Let's do that right now and then we're going to talk a little bit about exactly what we're going to

29
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,110
build in section 2.

30
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,730
So I'm going to first open up my code editor.

31
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,840
We're going to go to get hub and clone that code for the starter package.

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:23,460
We're going to go to get hub dot com slash Stephen Grider slash lyrical lyrical dash graph.

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,700
Q Well I can't take this link right here.

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,560
I mean I copy it just really quick so that you can definitely see it on the screen.

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:37,210
So just to make sure you get the right spelling Dubcek lyrical dash graphical.

36
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:44,950
So I'm going to go directly there and we can download all these project files one of two ways we can

37
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:51,730
either download it as a full zip file and then extract the contents of the directory or we can clone

38
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,070
it by using get.

39
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm going to go ahead and download it using good song and copy the link right here and then go back

40
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,540
over to my working project directory.

41
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,850
So do notice that I'm not inside of the directory that we were using previously and not inside of that

42
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,520
user's directory that we had previously created.

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,000
This is a completely new directory that we're getting working in.

44
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,940
So you'll get to clone the package and grab that link one more time.

45
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:26,330
And then once we're down done cloning it I will change into that folder and we will install or dependencies

46
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,590
with NPM install.

47
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,980
So this will take just a moment or two to finish up while it's running.

48
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,650
Let's continue in the next section and we'll talk a lot more about exactly what we're going to be building

49
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,520
in this next application.
