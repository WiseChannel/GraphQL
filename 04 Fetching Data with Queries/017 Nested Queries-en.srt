1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,620
Jay Sun server now has the idea of companies.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:10,790
So we're going to pivot back over to our graph Cuil schema and add in the idea of a company type inside

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,590
my schema.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,480
Yes file.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,130
I'm going to find my user type.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,220
Here it is right here and then right above it.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,820
We're going to add a couple of lines in on here we'll define our company type.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,180
So it's really important right now that you make sure you define your company type above the user type.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,700
OK.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,370
And that's me.

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,720
So it's really important we're going to circle back around in about oh five sections or so and we'll

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,840
talk about exactly why it's really important to take the order of definition into play here.

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,530
So I promise you I will come right back to why we're putting this right above.

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,820
We'll define the company type in the same exact fashion as how we do the user type previously.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,940
So say this is going to be a new graph.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:01:02,930
Q Well object type like so after that we will place the two required properties the name and the field

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,830
properties in here.

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:10,970
So we'll say it's going to have a name of company and it will have fields as well.

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,860
The company fields will be the ID the name and the description as well.

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,560
I think for all three of these a graft will strain will be the appropriate type just as we had previously

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,720
used over on the user type as well.

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:31,110
So a use ID Grath Well string.

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,600
We've got a name

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:44,300
and a description.

25
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,610
All right.

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,660
So so far it's looking awfully similar to our user type that we've put together previously.

27
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,150
Remember as I said earlier the first time you start working with the schema it feels a little bit funny.

28
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,310
You know he's got all these graphical variables floating around all these types floating around.

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,650
But the more and more you work with it you start to realize you're just writing the same code over and

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,460
over again which in some ways is a pretty darned good thing.

31
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,090
So now you've got the company type in place.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,490
We need to associate it with a user.

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,920
Now I don't want to overcomplicate associations at all here.

34
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,410
So let me be clear.

35
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:29,510
We treat associations between types get an association between the company type and the user type exactly

36
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,900
as though it were another field.

37
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,840
So if a user has a company property like I want to be told to walk from my user over to the company

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,320
on my graph of all my data I will add on the field company like so.

39
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,840
So we're just treating it like another field where we will define the type and the resolve function

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,240
ourselves.

41
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:59,630
So for the company we'll say that okay when we get this piece of data it's going to be a company type

42
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,780
you can start to imagine that perhaps these craft will induce and strings and you whatever other types

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,510
might come right out the box for us with graft well might have the exact same definition behind the

44
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,230
scenes as how we put together our company type really whether we are defining our own type as in the

45
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,520
case of company type or using one of the built in ones they're really treated all identically by graft.

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,800
Well OK so let's take a quick pause and we'll come back and continue working on the Company field right

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,370
here.

48
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,270
And this is a quick section but the next one is to me a little bit longer so I want to make sure that

49
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:45,260
we're going have a lot of time to work on exactly how we get the company associated with the user.

50
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,860
So let's take a quick break come back and finish that up.
