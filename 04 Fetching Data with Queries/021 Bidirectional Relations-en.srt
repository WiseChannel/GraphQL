1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,630
In the last section we hooked up our company to the route queery type so that in graphical we could

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:13,190
successfully ask for a very particular company without having to first ask for user.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,830
However if I now take this query and ask for you know who are all the users who are associated with

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,670
this company tell me their first names.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,510
We do this.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,640
We get an error message that says cannot create field users on type company.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,480
So why is that.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,190
It definitely feels like we should be able to ask a company for all the users who are who belong to

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,640
that company but it turns out that we haven't actually set up that definition yet or that relationship.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,880
This is a diagram of all the different relations that we have implemented so far.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,110
We've instructed our root query on how to return a very particular user.

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,230
We've connected our user to a company so we can say hey user what company do you belong to.

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,960
We have the ability to go from a user over to a company but we do not yet have the ability to go from

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,560
a company over to a user.

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,720
So for every single one of these relationships going from one type of data over to another type we have

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,200
to set up the relationship manually.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,350
So right now we've got going from left to right.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,500
What we want to have is something like this where we can go from a user to a company or from a company

19
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,710
to a list of all the different users who belong to that company.

20
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,710
So let's get started on the implementation before we do.

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,480
I just want to remind you one more thing.

22
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:42,410
Every company that we have is has a Association of multiple users so many users belong to just one company

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,470
with the relationship that we've set up so far we can go from a single user over to a single company

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,930
that totally makes sense.

25
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:58,180
But when we go from a company over to our users I would expect to get back a list of multiple users.

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,760
Okay time for implementation.

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,780
We're going to handle this in two separate steps.

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,160
First we need to check out our Jason server and figure out how to get our list of users given a company

29
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,170
ID.

30
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:19,030
So in my browser I'm going to open up a new tab and will navigate to our Jason server.

31
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,410
I'm going to look out my company with ID number one.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,260
So your company would like you one to get a list of all the users who are associated with company I.D.

33
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,810
one we can add on slash users like so.

34
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,130
So we looked at this previously.

35
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,950
I just wanted to remind you how we go from learning a little bit about a company to all the users who

36
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,930
are social with that company.

37
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,620
We can also look at company with I.T. too and that will give us all the users who are associated with

38
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,120
the company too.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,730
Again this is a reminder we looked at this a couple of sections ago.

40
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,050
This is a relationship that is set up for us automatically by on server just because we add it on the

41
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,980
company ID property to each of our users.

42
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,720
OK.

43
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,120
So this is step number one.

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Figuring out how to go from a company over to a list of users.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,280
Let's continue working on the rest of the implementation inside of our schema file in the next section.
