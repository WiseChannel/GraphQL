1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,350
In the last section we put together our mutation to like an individual lyric.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,650
We now need to make sure that we sandwich the mutation together with our component and we also need

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,850
to import the GQ well and graph the helpers at the top.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,040
So let's first do our import statements and then come back to the bottom of the file or scroll all the

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,820
way up to the top of this component.

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,630
And I'll place my two in-court statements.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:38,330
So we need to get the graph Cuil helper from re-act Apollo and GQ L from graft UL tag.

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,770
So now we'll go back down to the very bottom

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,000
and I can place my GRATHWOHL helper.

10
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,990
We're going to take in the mutation and then the second set of parentheses are going to wrap the component

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,040
like so.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,820
OK.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,180
So this is looking pretty good.

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,350
I think we're about ready to do a test inside the browser.

15
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,360
The last step that we have to do is make sure that we actually call the mutation inside of our component

16
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,290
so I'm going to scroll back up a little bit all the way to our event handler as the event handler right

17
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:12,890
here.

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,100
We're going to make sure that we call the mutation and when we call the mutation we need to pass in

19
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,340
the ID of the lyric that we're trying to actually like.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,090
So I'll say this not Propst not mutate.

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,980
Remember that is exactly how we invoke or call one of our mutations we call does not prop's not mutate

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,250
and then we will pass in a set of queery variables to the mutation.

23
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:44,560
So variables is going to be the ID which is going to come from the argument of ID.

24
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,270
So we are again in a situation where we have a key and value that are identical.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,750
We're going to condense it down to just be Id like so.

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,850
And this is such a short statement.

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,180
You know what I can do a little bit of clean up here and just put the entire thing on a single line

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,120
of code.

29
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:00,940
OK.

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,060
That looks much better.

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,540
Now I think we're ready to give this a shot in the browser.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,960
So let's run it and see how we're doing.

33
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,920
I'm going to flip back over.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,260
Here we go.

35
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,970
I'm going to refresh Now you'll notice that right now we are not showing the total number of likes inside

36
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,400
of the lyric row right now.

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,170
So right now we're just going to click the button and ensure that the mutation is actually executed

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,710
then we will very shortly come back and show the number of likes on every single lyric.

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:41,280
So I clicked the button to like it and it looks like we're issuing the mutation and we get back the

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,200
updated lyric there is the ID and the number of likes that it has.

41
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,280
So that's definitely looking good.

42
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,090
Let's make sure that we place the number of likes on each lyric.

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,010
You flip back over to my code editor and then find the render lyrics helper method.

44
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,210
So this is where we are rendering out each individual lyric which of course makes it a great place for

45
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:12,450
us to add in the number of likes that the thing has the argument to this function is the lyric itself

46
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,630
and the lyric has a likes property.

47
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,730
We know this just because we've looked at our graph to l documentation which said yeah you're going

48
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:27,970
to get a number of likes whenever you fetch this thing so I'll add in my likes from the structure statement.

49
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:41,290
And then inside of the ally itself right after the icon plays the number of Wykes gone I think we're

50
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,830
ready to do a test again.

51
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm going to flip back over to my browser.

52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,040
And that's interesting.

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,750
Nothing is actually showing up on the screen yet.

54
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,740
So that's interesting.

55
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,600
Let's click on something.

56
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,610
Yeah still not doing anything here.

57
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,920
So clearly we've got a little bit of an issue.

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,020
Let's figure out exactly what's going on inside the next section.
