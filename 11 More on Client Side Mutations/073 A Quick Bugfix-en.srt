1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,550
Before we do a wrap up of our application there is one little bug I wanted to point out to you that

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,130
was introduced and we started to introduce the idea of Wykes to our application.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,730
So it's a reminder when we add a new lyric we run a mutation that grabs the whole song and all the associated

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,840
lyrics.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,110
Let's try adding another lyric right now and see what happens.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,260
Let's say and here is my lampshade.

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,820
I'll hit enter and you'll notice I see a big error message here.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:36,050
And I've got loading at the top of the screen and it appears that it's not actually resolving the request

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,040
at all.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,030
So this is a little bit of a bug in the Apollo world.

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,360
Again remember Apollo is still a developing technology.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,940
Let's check out the mutation that we run whenever we add a new lyric and then flip back over to my code

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,540
editor and if you recall we are using the lyric create form.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,110
Here it is right here and at the very bottom we can scroll down to find our mutation to add a new lyric

15
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,920
to an individual song.

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,890
So right now when we run that mutation we get back to song.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,400
Here we are asking for the ID we're asking for are all the lyrics around it.

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,190
But we are only asking for the ID and the content.

19
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,100
So that is what is causing an issue right now.

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,150
That's what throwing the error part of the application is expecting that we're going to know the number

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,870
of Wykes associated with each lyric but we are not actually asking for that data right now.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,360
So to get our error message to go away we have to include a request for the number of Wykes associated

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,330
with each lyric.

24
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,390
Now when we refresh the page in add in another lyric

25
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,870
and here's my other phone it is added as we would expect and everything works much better.

26
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,940
OK so again this is a little bit of an error or a bug in the Apollo side of things that requires us

27
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,890
to ask for the piece of data.

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,870
Hopefully it's something that we get resolved in the meantime.

29
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,950
I encourage you to generally make sure that if you are ever making use of some type of resource you

30
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,730
do your best to always make sure that you're grabbing the same properties off of that resource.

31
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,760
OK let's continue in the next section and really get to that wrap up for this application.
