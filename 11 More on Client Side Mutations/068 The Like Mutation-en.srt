1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,720
Not that we've got a place where we can intercept a user clicking on the thumbs up symbol we can start

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,730
thinking a little bit more about the mutation that we're going to call to like an individual lyric.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,250
So we're going to start off by first writing the mutation out inside of graphical then we'll move the

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,240
mutation over to our lyric list component and call it from the online function.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,390
So let's flip over to graphical.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,150
Here we go.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,430
And to get started.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,590
Let's first look at our documentation panel and check out some of the different mutations we have available.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,540
So click on mutation and all right.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,680
Looks like there is a very aptly named mutation in here like lyric.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,240
It expects us to call it with an ID and then it returns the light.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,300
The updated lyric remember that each lyric we have has a property called likes.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,720
So this is the number of likes that each lyric has.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,250
So presumably after we like lyric we can ask the lyric for the number of new likes that it has and get

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,490
the response back and somehow update our application with it.

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,820
So let's give this thing a shot.

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,140
The first thing we need to do is make sure that we have the ID of a lyric inside of our application.

18
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,640
So I need to get a list of all the lyrics that I have.

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,520
I'm going to check my docs again for that really quickly.

20
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:27,060
Let's go back to the root documentation explore all find my root query type and it looks like I can

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,530
either ask for a lyric by ID.

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,100
I think that since we're trying to get at the idea of a lyric here we will get our big list of songs

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,620
and then print out the ID of each lyric inside those songs.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,210
So we'll start there and then we'll do the mutation.

25
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,080
So I don't ask for a list of all my songs I want to hear about the lyrics associated with each and tell

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,920
me about the idea of each one and you give me that content to just so we can identify which lyric it

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,470
actually is.

28
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,790
So here's my list of songs it looks like the first song only has a single lyric here.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,790
I kind of want to work with a song that I've been showing in the browser which is a little bit lower

30
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,830
down on the screen so I'm just going to arbitrarily pick one of the ideas in here.

31
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:20,510
I'll say that I want to vote or I want to like the ID or see me the lyric at the very bottom here.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,170
So it has the content it was good I guess.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,780
And here is the idea that I want someone to copy this idea right here and then I will remove the query

34
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,660
and we'll start thinking about the mutation again.

35
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,030
So we just looked at the nutation documentation.

36
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,510
We know that the mutation requires us to pass in the ID of the letters that we're trying to like.

37
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,330
So I know that I'm going to need to provide a query variable because I want to specify the idea of the

38
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:56,100
lyric that I'm working with at run time or I want to dynamically specify the ID that I'm trying to like.

39
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,940
So say hey you should expect there to be a query variable around and it's going to have the ID of this

40
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,330
lyric right here.

41
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,110
Again we get this red squiggly here.

42
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,370
Just because we're not making uses query variable which is totally fine.

43
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,680
We will in just a second.

44
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,110
So now we can start to write out the actual mutation or remember the syntax for this.

45
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,670
We use the mutation keyword we name the mutation

46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,800
then we define the query variable that we expect to be passed to this mutation.

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,730
So we're going to say dollar sign ID and I'm going to indicate to graph quite well that it will be of

48
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,650
type Id just like we have a type string just like we have a type.

49
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:48,250
And do remember that this is one of those locations where we use an upper case d inside of ID.

50
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,280
Then we'll actually execute the mutation.

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,810
So I want to run like lyric.

52
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,530
I need to pass in the ID from somewhere.

53
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,360
So hey here's the ID.

54
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,160
I want you take the value of the ID from the query variable.

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,700
Dollar Sign ID.

56
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,520
So again remember the pneumonic here.

57
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,450
It's dollar sign type name dollar sign

58
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:21,530
after we create the lyric We will ask for the ID of the lyric that was created and I want to know how

59
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,230
many likes it now has.

60
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,750
So just tell me you know hey we just liked the thing.

61
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,570
How many are there now.

62
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,470
We're going to assume that the lyric that we are updating right here starts off with zero likes.

63
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,190
So when we first run this lyric or so I mean when we first run this mutation rate here I'm going to

64
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:45,060
accept expect to see a response come back where we only have one like assigned to it.

65
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,100
So I'm going to run this thing and ok.

66
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,770
Looks good.

67
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:54,380
I've got one like if I run a mutation again I got two three four and so on.

68
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,570
So every single time we run the mutation we're just incrementing the number of lights associated with

69
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,140
the individual lyric.

70
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,570
So this works perfectly.

71
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,290
I like it.

72
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,150
I think that we're ready to move this thing over to our component so I'm going to select the entire

73
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,210
mutation a copy it will flip over toward code editor.

74
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,460
I definitely want to place the mutation inside of the lyric list component because I want to call the

75
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:27,230
mutation from inside of the component and scroll down to the bottom of the file and underneath the component

76
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,250
definition will place our mutation

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,610
for probably the tenth time.

78
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm going to remind you that we want to have batiks back ticks here excuse me not single quotes.

79
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,150
So do make sure that you have back ticks.

80
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,510
OK.

81
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,800
I think this is probably a good place to take a break.

82
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,920
So let's pause for just a second.

83
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,530
When we come back we need to make sure that we wire up the mutation to the component and we also have

84
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,560
to make sure we get some import statements for both the L library and the graphics library.

85
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,900
So let's take care of both those tasks in the next section.
