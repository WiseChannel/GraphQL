1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,430
In the last section we added a little bit of code that definitely made me think that we should see the

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,520
number number of likes on each individual lyric.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,670
But as we can see absolutely no text is popping up to tell us the number of likes associated with each

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,720
lyric.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,030
So it's still a little bit of thinking and try to understand why this data isn't showing up.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,600
The first thing that I want to point out to you that can kind of guide us toward the answer or the fix

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,640
or solution for this problem is that it appears that none of the light numbers appear on the screen.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,330
When we first refresh the page.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,400
So I suspect that this is not something having to do with the mutation we put together instead.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,100
I suspect that it might be something around the Querrey that initially fetches the data for this page

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,790
right here.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,740
So the query that fetches an individual song and all the lyrics that are associated with that song.

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,780
If you recall we had put that query inside of the fetch song Querrey file.

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,430
So in my queries folder I can find the fetch song doc J.S. file and let's open it up.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,270
So this query takes the idea of the song that we're trying to fetch and then it returns the song Id

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,730
the song title and all the lyrics associate with that song as well.

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,220
You'll notice that the lyrics property in here we are not returning the number of likes associated with

18
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,050
that lyric.

19
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,580
So that's what the problem is here.

20
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,210
When we first load the page up we are not getting the likes back from the server.

21
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,910
And so we don't actually have the number of likes to show on the screen.

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,470
We can fix this by adding on the likes property like so I'll save this.

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,360
And let's flip back over to the browser and test it out and see how we're doing.

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,630
Back at the browser.

25
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,110
Refresh the page.

26
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:48,990
OK.

27
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:55,150
So now it looks like the styling is a little bit off but the number of likes is definitely on here.

28
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,440
And when I click on a button the number of likes automatically increments for each one.

29
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:09,270
Definitely the behavior that I was hoping for now having the styling look like this not super ideal.

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,010
So maybe we should do a little bit of work on the styling here as well so that the numbers aren't quite

31
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,910
so messed up with the thumbs up symbol to fix this.

32
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,190
We'll add in a little bit of GSX to our render Lyric's helper method.

33
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,200
Remember that is what renders each individual line here.

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,270
And then we'll also add in just a little bit of CSSA to clean it up as well.

35
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,930
So back in my code editor I unifying my lyric list file I'm going to scroll on down to the render lyrics

36
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,560
helper.

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,610
Here it is.

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,890
And I'm going to wrap the icon for the thumb up thumbs up and the number of likes inside of a div by

39
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,530
doing this.

40
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,230
It's going to make sure that I can contain and grouped together the icon and the number of likes.

41
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,690
So I'm going to add in a div here.

42
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,110
I'm also going to give it a class name of vote box so that we can add a little bit of CSSA to clean

43
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,200
it up.

44
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,050
And then notice that I'm also closing off the div down here underneath the icon and likes

45
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:20,450
So now put in just a little bit of CSSA to our style style that CSSA file your style that success.

46
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,620
And for the vote box I'm going to add in just a tiny bit of success.

47
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:36,930
I'm going to give it a display of flex and a line items Center the last thing I'm going to do is give

48
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,590
the material Icahn's class a margin right.

49
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,640
Of five pixels.

50
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,620
OK.

51
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:50,210
So this essentially says take the two items that are inside that div and make sure that they are vertically

52
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:50,970
aligned.

53
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,780
And then I also place little bit of margin on the material Icahn's class just to make sure that the

54
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,590
icon is not sandwich right up against the number of votes.

55
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,860
It's just going to ensure that there is a little bit of space between the icon and the actual vote number.

56
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:13,720
So I'm going to save this document and then flip back over to my browser will do a refresh.

57
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,210
All right.

58
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,820
That looks much better.

59
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:22,210
You will notice that as soon as the votes get into the double digits the vote and you can see that alignment

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,850
doesn't quite match up here.

61
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,000
That might be a good reason to swap the order of the two or we can also use a little bit more CSSA to

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,470
ensure the alignment works a little bit better but that's definitely something that I'll leave it to

63
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,010
you to work on just a little bit for the CSF side.

64
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,500
All right.

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,270
I really like how this application is turning out but there's one last thing in here that's really annoying.

66
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:51,320
You'll notice that whenever we click on the button there is kind of that little imperceptible pause

67
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,100
like just a quarter of a second or half a second.

68
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,080
We're where we are waiting for the vote to be registered by the back end and then update the UI when

69
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,980
we get the response back.

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,670
That's not the best experience in the world.

71
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:11,090
And I would personally really like it if there was some way that we could say well I want to vote this

72
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,870
post right here.

73
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,860
Or this lyric and I want that number to instantly just instantly be incremented.

74
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,300
So let's see if we can't resolve this little flub in the UI or this kind of user experience that we

75
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,580
have right now to make it seem like a much faster and a much snap your Web site.

76
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,650
So let's investigate that in the next section.
