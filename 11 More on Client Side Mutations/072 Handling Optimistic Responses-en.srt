1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,950
We're now ready to implement an optimistic response from our mutation we're going to do a little bit

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,870
of reformatting first and put the variables term on a new line because we're going to need a good amount

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,070
of space here.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,750
Next we're going to say hey here's the optimistic response when this mutation runs I want you to try

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,150
to just early use this data as soon as possible.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:32,690
So I say here's the optimistic response like so do triple check your spelling of optimistic right here.

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,660
Very easy place to make a little typo.

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,100
Now the next part is something that's not the best thing in the world because it's kind of hard to explain.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,740
It might seem on the one hand really obvious but on the other hand why is it here.

10
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:55,210
So we have to specifically say that we are making a mutation like so now the next part is the part that's

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,880
much more straightforward.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,390
We're going to provide the response that we are going to expect to see from our back and server.

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,870
And when I say that I'm talking about exactly what we see in our response log right here.

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:14,110
So like Eric the type name the ID of the record that was updated and the number of likes that it should

15
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,960
now have.

16
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,900
So we'll say like lyric because that's exactly what we saw in the response log.

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,700
We'll provide the ID of the record that was changed.

18
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:31,510
And remember we already received the ID as an argument to the online callback will then provide the

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:39,160
type name which is Lirot type just as we saw in the request log and do note that there's two underscores

20
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,720
right here.

21
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,320
Make sure you've got two.

22
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,850
And then finally we have to provide the number of likes.

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,530
So we don't really have access to the number of lights inside of callback right here but recall that

24
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:56,490
we are calling this call back on like from within the render lyrics map function.

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,900
So if we scroll down just a little bit here's where we call on like.

26
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,170
And we already have access to the current number of likes within that function.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:14,380
So we're going to provide the lights as a second argument to the callback like so now backup talk inside

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:21,090
the callback we can receive the number of likes and then this is the real key.

29
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,060
This is the super important part we're going to take that number of likes and we're going to add one.

30
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,020
So that is the optimistic part of the response.

31
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,320
We are guessing that the request is going to go through successfully and we are hoping that when the

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,950
response comes back there's going to be an increment value for the number of likes right there.

33
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,230
So that's pretty much it for optimistic response.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,350
Again we defined the optimistic response as a property when we call the mutation.

35
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,810
We have to then provide a type name of mutation and then the really important part is we essentially

36
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,360
duplicate the code or whatever we expect to see is the response from the back end.

37
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:07,050
In practice the approach that we just took where we looked at the mutation inside of our request log

38
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,100
that is absolutely what I recommend you do on your own application.

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,350
Look at run the mutation yourself look at the mutation inside the requests log right here and you can

40
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,170
literally just copy paste that whole chunk right there and stick it into the optimistic response like

41
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,840
so.

42
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,330
And then for every variable that you expect to have obviously a summit summit excuse me sub it out.

43
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,940
So like I expect the idea to not be hardcoded I expect it to be dynamic value which is why I'm specifying

44
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,210
it on the fly right here.

45
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,470
Deal with the I do want to point out is yes we can condense this down using a little bit of ESX syntax

46
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:50,080
to be just Id like so okay I think we're ready for a little bit of a test on this.

47
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,810
I'm going to flip over to my code editor and I'm going to refresh the page

48
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,700
and I think I've got a little bit of a typo in here somewhere.

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,700
Yep got a typo somewhere.

50
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,150
I think I missed a comma.

51
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,400
Let me do a quick double check

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,760
sorry right after variables Mr. Khama again will refresh again.

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,960
All right much better.

54
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,490
So now as we test this the expectation is that the instant I click on the thumbs up button I should

55
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:33,530
see the number increment but then the request should only resolve some tiny amount of time later.

56
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,900
Remember we're not delaying the request at all.

57
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,460
The request is still being issued instantly.

58
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,350
The only change is at this time around.

59
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,590
We are guessing at what the update should be for the UI.

60
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,020
So I'm going to click on this one and you'll notice that the number increments automatically but about

61
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:56,340
a quarter of a second later the request is actually responded to like so now your immediate question

62
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,950
might be.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,030
Well Stephen what happens if I guess incorrectly what happens if I thought that the like was going to

64
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,540
go through.

65
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,910
But it turns out that the server rejects it or it turns out that the number of likes is actually much

66
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,210
greater than we expected.

67
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,560
Because maybe many other people have been voting on this post right here.

68
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,750
In the meantime that's a great question and we can very easily see what happens.

69
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm going to flip back over to the optimistic update in here.

70
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,130
So here it is right here.

71
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,900
And here's the number of likes.

72
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:31,020
So what we know right now you and I know that whenever we run this mutation it's going to increment

73
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:38,910
the number of likes by 1 but let's just say you know what maybe we made a big mistake and maybe we think

74
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:45,330
that on the client side we believe that it's going to be changed by 12 but the server still is only

75
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,200
going to be incrementing by 1.

76
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,900
So let's see what happens now.

77
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,020
I'm going to refresh the page again OK.

78
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,910
So now when I click on the button.

79
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:56,440
Ah.

80
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,560
Now that's some interesting behavior.

81
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,420
The instant I click on the button the number adjusts by 12.

82
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,370
That's the optimistic update.

83
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,040
But as soon as the response comes in from the back end we get the real truth which is that it was only

84
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,720
incremented by one.

85
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,570
So you can see that optimistic updates are a pretty safe strategy for really increasing the speed of

86
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,970
your UI.

87
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,320
The only kind of risk here is that if you start doing things incorrectly your user is going to see that

88
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,290
kind of jump of data which is very much unexpected for them.

89
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,630
But in general at the end of the day it's not going to break anything per se.

90
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,870
You're not going to go totally out of whack here.

91
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,100
The UI will automatically eventually resolve to the correct answer.

92
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,510
OK.

93
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,130
So that's optimistic responses.

94
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,870
Let's continue in the next section and do a little bit of a wrap up on this application.

95
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,250
OK.

96
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:48,960
One last thing.

97
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,120
Let's make sure that we change the lights back to one area.

98
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,920
All right let's go to the next section and do a little wrap up on this application.
