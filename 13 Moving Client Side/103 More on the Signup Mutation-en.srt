1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,110
Now that are sign up form has access to the sign up nutation and they've been wired together with a

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,430
graph help or we can have a callback function to the sign up form itself and then pass that down into

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,800
the auth form.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:20,530
So let's first create that callback and then pass it down into the form I'm going to add on the callback

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,710
function which will be on submit.

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,890
We expect that this is going to be called with the email and password that the user entered into the

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:39,730
form that will immediately pass it on to our form as on some it will specify on submit and we'll make

8
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,530
sure to bind the context to that function as well.

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,750
So we're doing exactly the same thing that we were doing with the log in form as well.

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,470
Remember that the auth form component expects to be provided in on submit function if it is provided

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,300
that function it will call it with the email and password in an object.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:05,900
So then inside of on submit we can freely call or mutation and in that email and password as query variables.

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,400
So let's do that right now.

14
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:15,590
We'll call this doc prob stot mutate and we'll specify the variables that we want to pass in there.

15
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,710
So these are the query variables of email and password that should be that e-mail and password used

16
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,550
to create the new account.

17
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,330
So this is looking pretty good.

18
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,490
I think there were just about ready for a test inside the browser.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,650
There's just one little gotcha that you might run into if you try to test this inside the browser right

20
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,800
now.

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,740
Recall that inside the art form and as matter of fact Lissa's pull the form up right now so we can look

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,560
at the code for it.

23
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,360
So here's my offer for.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm down inside of the render function.

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,970
So it is rendered right here.

26
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,480
And I scroll down just a little bit more to the air helper that we put inside of here.

27
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,220
So about nine thirty six or so we've got this props.

28
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,020
There's a map.

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,340
So right now our form is assuming that we are always passing in an array of errors.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,670
Now that array might be completely empty that's fine but if we do not pass in a prop called errors that

31
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:16,060
is an array we'll immediately get an error message as we try to map over undefined or knoll or whatever

32
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,910
the value of errors might be.

33
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,300
So before we try to test this out inside the browser we do need to make sure that inside of our Sign-Up

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,200
form we find that Auth. form tag.

35
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,760
And we at least pass in an empty list of errors.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,120
So I'm going to do this just very temporarily until we add in some error handling code to our actual

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,040
mutation to make sure that when the auth form attempts to render when it calls this start prop's dot

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,780
dot map we will not get an error message.

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,920
So by just providing an empty array here we can safely map over the empty array and fantastically no

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,160
error message.

41
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:55,920
OK.

42
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,060
So the sign of form should be ready to go.

43
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,100
Now the last thing you have to do is make sure that it is wired up as a route inside of our re-act rudder

44
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,060
application.

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,170
So we have not yet assigned it to any route inside of our app.

46
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:14,040
Let's do that right now inside of our top level client directory will find the index not js file.

47
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,020
So this is where we put all of our re-act router configuration will import the sign up form at the top

48
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:29,360
from components sign up form and then we can add a route inside of our root component.

49
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:37,270
So here's our route component a little bit lower and we'll add another route to the path sign up that

50
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:46,310
will show our sign up form do you recall that we added a link inside of our Hetter.

51
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,220
That assumes that the path to the sign up form was going to be Sign-Up.

52
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,530
So there is a very good reason on coloring the sign up at least.

53
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,800
I should say we already made the assumption it was going to be called Sign up.

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,380
So if you change it to anything else right here do make sure that you update the link inside the header

55
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,540
as well.

56
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,330
OK.

57
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,630
So I think we're just about ready for a test here.

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,140
My expectation is that we should be able to go to the sign up form.

59
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,760
We should be able to enter a email and password and create a brand new account.

60
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,400
So I'm going to flip on over to the browser or refresh the page

61
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,050
and I'm going to make sure that I'm logged out and only log out first and then I'll be able to click

62
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,990
on the sign up link.

63
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,400
OK that's much better.

64
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,700
So here's my Sign-Up up link right here.

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,820
I clicked on sign up and I can see the form successfully.

66
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,310
Now I want to do just clear up my request log here really really quickly notice I am on the network

67
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,500
tab of my chrome console.

68
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,750
Again as usual.

69
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,640
I want to see the nutation going off to our back end and just verify that it is being handled appropriately

70
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,560
and actually creating a new account.

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,790
So entering a new e-mail to sign up with now I need to make sure that it's e-mail that I've never used

72
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:04,480
before because we do have the restriction that all the different e-mails we use must not be or they

73
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,500
must all be unique inside of our users collection sorry.

74
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,790
Test 5 6 7 at test dot com and we'll use a password of password.

75
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,820
So when I submit this I get my nutation going off to the back end.

76
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:27,010
And it looks like my new user has been successfully created and presumably I am now authenticated with

77
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,650
the application.

78
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,050
Now there are two lingering issues that we probably have to take care of.

79
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,300
Many of them I should say three.

80
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,190
First off we do have to still take care of some error handling.

81
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:45,730
So notice if I try to submit this again and then look at the new mutation request that was issued.

82
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,430
I now have a error message on Ayres property with the message of e-mail in use.

83
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,160
So do have to make sure that I take care of showing the errors on the form itself.

84
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:02,380
In addition you'll also notice that my header is not updating appropriately so I do have to run the

85
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,770
query or refresh the query to get the current user.

86
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,900
And then finally and this is still a lingering issue with our sign up form or it's in our log in form

87
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:17,040
as well we do need to make sure that after successfully logging in we navigate away from this page automatically.

88
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,900
So still a few things to take care of.

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,150
Let's take a quick break and then take care of the air messaging and prefetching the current user query

90
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,500
inside the next section.
