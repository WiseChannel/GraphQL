1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,980
Are header component is starting to behave the way we expect in terms of what content it's showing.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,030
But each case of whether or not the user is currently authenticated or not is only showing some raw

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,060
text on the screen and not anything useful that actually allows the user to say log out of our application

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,130
or to go to a forum where they can sign in.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,580
One thing I want to point out before we start working on this component is that I just wired up materialized

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,690
CSSA to my project right here so yours probably already looks like this.

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,550
I just added it into mine as well.

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,460
And so thats why you are seeing the big change in styling from the last section to this one right now.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,100
OK.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,780
So let's get started again.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,660
I want to make sure that whenever we show this log out link or the you're not signed in text I don't

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,130
want to show just the plain text.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,470
I want to show something actually useful.

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:56,040
So if I show log out I want to have the ability to actually log my user out of the application or in

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,050
the case that the user is not signed in.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,130
I want to show some links that take the user to a form where they can sign up or log into our app.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,330
So let's enhance our behavior around both these elements right here.

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,880
The first thing I want to do is add on a little bit of a wrapper element to the destock rendered buttons

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,030
called down here to make the styling work just a little bit more nicely than it is right now.

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,830
So I'm going to wrap the call to that helper function with the UL that has a class name of.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,800
Right.

22
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,480
So that's going to make sure that all the content that is rendered by render buttons is pulled to the

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,340
right hand side of the header which is where I traditionally want to have some links that have to do

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,870
with navigation appear on the screen.

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,590
The next thing I'm going to do is to add on a link to the left hand side of the header.

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,740
So presumably somewhere right here that will allow the user to go back to the root page of our entire

27
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,860
application.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,540
So I'm going to scroll to the top and we're going to import the link helper from re-act router.

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,120
Remember the link helper allows us to render an anchor tag that works the way we expect with re-act

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,560
router.

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,640
So import link will come back down to the bottom and I'm going to add on a linked tag to my route route

32
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,960
with a class name brand logo and left

33
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,180
and I'm going to give it a text home so the user you know very clear OK I click on this thing and I

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,580
go back to the home of the application.

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,100
So let's give this little bit of a test between the two changes that we just made five foot back over

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,580
and refreshed the page.

37
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,720
OK I got the nice big home text on the screen.

38
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,480
It is a link so I can click it if I wish.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,620
And then I can also see on the right hand side.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,660
I'm not signed in.

41
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,830
So clearly we still need to do just a little bit of work over there on the right hand side but we'll

42
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,250
take care of that in a moment.

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,750
OK.

44
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,130
So let's take a look at our rendered buttons helper now.

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,760
So this is where we're going to want to enhance some of our behavior and make sure that these things

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,470
are rendering a little bit more useful content than what we've currently got.

47
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,360
I think that perhaps we should first start with a case that the user is not signed in.

48
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,400
So if the user is not signed in I want to show two buttons or two links on the screen.

49
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:25,010
I want to show a link that will allow the user to go to a form to sign up or to go to a form to allow

50
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,680
them to log in or sign in to the application.

51
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:36,080
So since I want two different elements to be returned from this case right here I remember I 3x.

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,320
I always have to return a single root element even if I want to return to different lengths.

53
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,790
So rather than returning to different lengths at the same time I can return a single top level div and

54
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,370
then inside of there I'll place two different lengths that will show up on the screen.

55
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:59,150
So I'm going to place 1 ally this is helping us with a little bit of styling with with the materialized

56
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,010
CSSA remember that by default we're showing a UL down here.

57
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:09,140
The UL is intended to wrap a series of lies which just helped to make a series of links show up nicely

58
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,200
inside of the header.

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,350
That inside of your will place a link tag that will take the user to a page where they can sign up or

60
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,320
log into our application.

61
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:25,480
So place tag you know put this on two lines just to make it a little more legible.

62
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,250
Now we haven't really spoken about the different routes inside of her application too much.

63
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,470
Definitely it's clear that we have to have a page that shows a forum where a user can sign up in a form

64
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,980
or a user can log in.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,090
So I'm just going to decide right now somewhat arbitrarily that we will call the route where users will

66
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,570
see a form to sign up.

67
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,240
We'll call that very plainly.

68
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,690
Just sign up.

69
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,290
So this route does not yet exist inside of our application but we will be creating it very shortly to

70
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,210
make sure that whenever user goes there they'll see a form that allows them to create a new account

71
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,300
and sign into our application.

72
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:10,470
Then inside of the slip tag we can show the text sign up and then we'll place another lie.

73
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:19,400
This one is going to allow the user to log in to our application.

74
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,590
So really I'm doing the same thing here.

75
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,850
We do not yet have a route called log in the of an application.

76
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,730
I'm just making the assumption that we will want to make a route called log in when a user goes there

77
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:38,080
we'll show them a form that allows them to log into our application.

78
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,630
The last thing that we want to do is start thinking about the log out button up here.

79
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,780
So right now it's just a plain div and we probably don't want it to be just a plain day.

80
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,640
We probably want it to be something more like a button that the user can click to log out of the application.

81
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,090
So let's first refresh our document and make sure that these two link tags are showing up correctly

82
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,780
and then we'll start worrying about how to log out the user is going to flip back over will refresh

83
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:13,260
and I correctly see a big log in and sign up link on the top right inside of my head.

84
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,460
So this is definitely looking pretty good definitely the way we want to go.

85
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,970
Of course if I click either one we have not yet to find these routes.

86
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,960
So I get an error message in the console once we come back in to find these routes.

87
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,510
Then everything's going to work the way we expect.

88
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,610
I can still click on the home tag over here to make sure that I go back to the root router of the application

89
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,400
and then I can still refresh to get everything to show up the way I expect.

90
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:37,740
OK.

91
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,600
So as far as styling goes I think that this is looking pretty good and we're definitely going down the

92
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,650
right path here.

93
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,930
Let's take a quick break and then come back and start putting together this link on the top hand of

94
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,200
the page to make sure that we can log out of our application.
