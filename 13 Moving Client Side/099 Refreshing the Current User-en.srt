1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,480
In the last section we finished up our log in form and we were able to see the mutation successfully

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,300
the issue to our back end.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,440
However after we ran the mutation nothing really happened on the page.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,050
So we didn't see the header update and we didn't get automatically navigated anywhere.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,390
And in both cases I really would expect something to happen after my user successfully logs in.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,630
And there's one other thing I want to point out as well.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,930
If I change the password out here and say put in some random string of characters and submit.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,960
I can look at the mutation that's returned and I definitely get an error object in here.

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,110
But I'm giving absolutely no feedback to my user or to tell them how you entered in some bad information.

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,550
So we still have a pretty good amount of work to do on this log in form so let's get to it.

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,480
The first thing I'd like to take care of is make sure that we're maintaining the header in the correct

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,380
fashion.

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,410
So after we make our mutation requests to log the user in I want to make sure that I attempt to fetch

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,780
the current user by running the current user query as we saw previously inside the header.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,870
When we were logging a user out if we just rerun the current user query the headers should automatically

16
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,410
update with the new data that is being fetched from the backend.

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,280
So I'm going to first work on that by changing on over to my log in form where we're currently calling

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,250
our mutation.

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,950
So here is the mutation as this start Propst mutate.

20
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,490
Now to add in the ability to refresh the current user it's going to be exactly the same as we saw inside

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,140
our head.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,140
So after the mutation runs we will execute that other query by defining the prefetch queries property

23
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,850
inside of here.

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,070
Now before I forget do make sure do be sure to make sure we put on the comma at the end of the variables

25
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,590
line over here as well.

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:56,490
So then after the mutation is finished we will rerun the current user query or the query to get the

27
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,190
current user.

28
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,620
Do remember that we have to import that into this file as well.

29
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:08,480
So at the top add an import statement for query from queries.

30
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,880
Current User.

31
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,250
And of course don't forget to put the double dot to indicate that we're going up one directory into

32
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,980
the client folder and then down into queries.

33
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,060
OK so this one was kind of a guinea.

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,250
I think this was a easy fix here.

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,890
I definitely would expect the application will work the way we expect at this point so let's do a little

36
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,690
test and make sure that's the case.

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,440
I'm going to flip back over to your application and I'll first refresh the page and make sure that I'm

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,190
logged out.

39
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,370
So going to click on log out right here and.

40
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,680
OK.

41
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,110
I feel reasonably assured at this point that I am logged out of the application.

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,990
So now I'm going to enter in a valid e-mail and password combination.

43
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,720
And after we submit it to log in I expect to see the header get updated.

44
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:03,240
So enter test at test dot com and a password of password isn't it this my mutation is successfully issued.

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,740
So I am now logged into my application.

46
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,160
Then the follow up request is made to get the current user or the application when the response comes

47
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,370
back that query response goes to every single component that is making use of that current user query

48
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,150
and that includes the header.

49
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,570
So the header automatically renders with the new data that has been fetched and it goes over to just

50
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,720
showing the log out button.

51
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,820
So that's challenge number one that we've successfully taken care of.

52
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,160
So let's take a quick break and we're going to move on to challenge number two which is to make sure

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,830
that whenever a user enters some invalid input into the form we show some validation message to let

54
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,540
them know that hey you maybe didn't put in the correct information here.

55
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,020
Please try again.

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,640
So let's take a quick break come back.

57
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,150
Take care.

58
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,800
Validation.
