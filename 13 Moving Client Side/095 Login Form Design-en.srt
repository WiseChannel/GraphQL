1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,120
Our header is at a pretty good spot right now.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,670
So I think that we're about ready to move on over to our authentication forms for both signing up and

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,020
sign in to our application as a quick reminder.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,690
Let's check out our wireframe Zarar mockups for these two forms that we have to make.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,320
So we've got both the page to sign up a new user and to sign an existing user in.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,720
Now I had previously said that these are two separate components.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,860
But when we look at them closely they both have the email and password fields on them and the submit

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,330
button.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,930
So looks like there is really not too much difference between these two forms.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,080
So maybe there's a little bit of code sharing that we can do in here.

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,180
Of course once we enter that email and password we're going to call a dramatically different mutation

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,660
depending on which form are displayed on the screen.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,090
So there does still have to be a little bit of customization there.

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,860
With that in mind I think I've got a plan on how we can get a little bit of code reuse going here.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,350
So this is what I'm thinking.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,650
I'm thinking that we'll make a log in form component and a sign up form component but they will both

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,680
make use of a common component called the auth form the auth form right here.

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,900
Will it contain the actual form element with the labels the inputs and the buttons that we want to show

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,140
on the form itself.

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,940
But as soon as the user clicks submit to submit the form will pass us and we will call a callback that

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,650
is passed from the parent down into the form.

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:34,500
By doing that we can have all the common logic around rendering the form itself inside of the form but

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,710
for handling the very customized logic around which mutation we call to actually log in or sign up the

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,710
user we can to find that mutation inside of the parent component.

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,430
So basically the plan is to parent components will display each them on two different routes inside

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,550
of the reactor configuration and then each them will show an instance of the form itself.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,040
So I think that's probably a good plan to move forward on.

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,490
Well first start off with the log in form since you already have a user account.

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,200
And I think that's going to be maybe a very slightly easier of the two.

30
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:13,700
So we'll make the log and form component then we'll make the form component and define the actual form

31
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,660
inside of it.

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,110
So let's get started.

33
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:24,610
Inside of my components directory I'm going to make a new file called loggin form.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,740
Yes.

35
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,850
Now inside if you're all we really have to do right now is define some scaffolding for the component

36
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,350
import this imaginary Auth. form that we're talking about.

37
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,440
So the components that's going to show the actual form and then show that inside of this one.

38
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,860
So just a little bit of work to get started and then we'll come back and customize it a little bit with

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,800
the actual mutation.

40
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:53,140
So we'll start off by importing react and the Component class from react.

41
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:02,790
Scuse me lowercase r then we'll define our class log in form which will extend the component class all

42
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,740
the fine.

43
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,620
Just a little bit of boilerplate inside of the render method.

44
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:13,810
Right now it's a meal that is placed in div for good measure and at the very bottom will export default

45
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,370
log in form like so.

46
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,110
OK.

47
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,740
So it seems like a reasonable start.

48
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,230
I now want to associate this with the re-act router and make sure that it's working with one of our

49
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,540
existing routes.

50
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,220
So I'm going to open up my index file where I've got all the configuration for re-act router.

51
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:39,460
I'm going to import the component I just created as log in form from components log and form like so

52
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:46,520
and I'm going to generate a new route that's going to show the log in form so scroll down a little bit

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,890
of find my overall route help right here and I'm going to make sure that whenever a user goes to the

54
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,550
path

55
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:04,920
log in I'm going to show the component loggin form OK.

56
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,880
So looks like a good place to get started.

57
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,060
So we should now at least feel to go do slash log in and see the log in form component appear on the

58
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,770
screen.

59
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,060
Let's do a quick test right now just to make sure everything's working the way we expect.

60
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,090
So I'll flip back over to my app or refresh the page.

61
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,620
And then we've set up this logon button over here so I shouldn't have to actually type the route in

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,900
Asheville or just click log in and see it log and foreign appear on the screen.

63
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,450
Now looks like we don't immediately get the form on the screen so we might have a small typo somewhere.

64
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,360
Let's double check our actual component of log in form.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,120
Yes we haven't actually add anything to the div just yet.

66
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,330
So it's just out in a little bit of dummy text in there of log in form.

67
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,750
And now we can refresh the page and see that text appear on the screen.

68
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,220
OK.

69
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,400
So that's looking good.

70
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,740
Let's take a quick break.

71
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,550
We're going to come back and then we're going to start working on this off form which is going to show

72
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,860
the actual form that the user is going to type their input into.
