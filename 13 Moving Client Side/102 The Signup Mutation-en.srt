1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,280
In the last section we finished working on our blog and form component and we had said that we need

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,140
to both start working on our sign up form and also make sure that we take care of the case in which

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,830
a user successfully authenticates with our application now to handle the case in a user which has user

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,270
successfully logged in.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,870
We're going to navigate them to some imaginary dashboard component that we have not yet created.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,220
So if you recall we had said that once a user had logged in we would show something called like Dashboard

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,470
would have a message that says welcome back or something similar to that.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,370
Our sign of form is going to navigate to the same component as well.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,170
So I'm kind of thinking that we'll first put together our sign up form over here and then we'll worry

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,690
about putting together the dashboard component and an update both the sign in and the sign up forms

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,970
to navigate over to the dashboard after the user successfully authenticates.

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,220
So let's start with our sign up form which should be pretty quick to get through and then we'll start

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,340
working on the dashboard.

14
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,120
So we got a ton of files open right now.

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,320
I'm going to close a couple of them.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:07,880
OK.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,250
I feel so much better.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,210
So let's get started.

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,000
We've got on a log in form we're going to make a sign up form and in practice it's going to look nearly

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,690
identical to this to the log in form.

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,750
So I'm going to make a new component called sign up form.

22
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,470
Yes.

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,660
One thing I want to mention about the nomenclature here.

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,400
I've got sign up with the lower case you.

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,260
Some people like to use UPPER CASE YOU FOR up whatever you do.

26
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,150
Just make sure you stay consistent and you don't some in some places have Kapolei you and then in other

27
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,070
locations lower case you just make sure you stay consistent.

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:46,340
OK.

29
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,420
So the form itself to sign a user up is going to look very darn similar to the log and form that we

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,750
were just working on.

31
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,680
So we're going to put together a class based component.

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,540
We're going to have a Errors piece of state to track all the ears with signing user up.

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,170
We're going to show our form which is our reusable piece of code that we've been handling around and

34
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,130
we'll make sure that whenever the off form gets submitted it has a callback to invoke to run the sign

35
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,710
up nutation to create a new user and authenticate them.

36
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,580
So we've got a pretty good amount of typing ahead of us and I think that we've also got pretty good

37
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,600
direction.

38
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,450
So let's start getting through it.

39
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:36,150
We'll start by importing react and the component base class and then we will put down our boiler plate

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,490
for the sign up form itself.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,680
We'll do our render method again.

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,280
I think that right now we can just start off with a simple div which we will replace in time with or

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,770
add to in time with the form and maybe an age 3 header at the top as well.

44
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,650
Then at the bottom we will export default.

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,530
Sign up form code.

46
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,130
I think maybe a good place to start will be to import the auth form and show it inside of this things

47
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,240
render method.

48
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:19,270
So let's import the Auth. form from the form and make sure that we show it inside the thing like so.

49
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:19,810
OK.

50
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,640
That's a good start.

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,930
That's an easy one.

52
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,700
We can add on and 3 as well to let the user know that this form that they're looking up is all about

53
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,470
signing up.

54
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,700
It's all put in H-3 with sign up in there and maybe before we do anything else we should start worrying

55
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,870
about the mutation that we need to write to to sign a user up to our application.

56
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,890
So this is another case where we've already written the mutation but we didn't write it in a name mutation

57
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,100
sort of way.

58
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,170
So we need to make sure that we write the name mutation that except some number of query variables then

59
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:58,650
we'll add it to a nutation file in our mutations folder and then we'll add it to the sign up form component.

60
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:08,150
So let's first switch over to graphical insider browser and we'll update this mutation to create a new

61
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,600
user

62
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,160
as usual.

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,110
I would really like to take a glance at our docs panel and look at our nutation object in here.

64
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,190
And just remember that you know it's called sign up that's our mutation name.

65
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,330
It accepts an e-mail and a password to authenticate our user.

66
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,290
So we will start off by defining are two variables.

67
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,140
I'll do an email and notice that I'm going to give it a different e-mail than any one that I've used

68
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:45,570
previously because I do want to make sure that this succeeds the first time through our password password

69
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,390
as well.

70
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,850
See how we can do our named the mutation of sign up we're going to specify that it expects to query

71
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,600
variables the e-mail and the password and both them are going to be strings.

72
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:06,990
So we all accept e-mail which would be a string and password which would be a string.

73
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,600
Then we can define the actual mutation itself.

74
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,620
So here sign up.

75
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,150
It's going to receive a email query variable.

76
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,720
Coming from the email query variable like so and it's also going to receive a password variable coming

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,700
from the password.

78
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,980
Variable.

79
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:32,110
And then again we'll ask for the ID and the email of the user who has created.

80
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,310
OK so I think that I really expect this to run successfully the first time that I executed because I

81
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,320
have a brand new e-mail address in here that I've never used before.

82
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:49,640
So I'm going to run this mutation and I successfully get back to the ID and email of this new user.

83
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,230
So this is looking pretty good.

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,000
I think that we can move this mutation over to a new mutation file and then important and wired up to

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,660
one of our components.

86
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:06,010
So I'm going a copy of the mutation I'm going to create my new mutation file which I'm going to call

87
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:17,330
sign up J.S. will import the GQ El helper from graft UL tag and then export defaults.

88
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:24,880
GQ well with our tactics and I successfully called it got tix this time not query string which is just

89
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,570
fantastic.

90
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,560
OK.

91
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:33,100
So we are importing the graft you all tagged helper which allows us to define mutations in queries within

92
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,930
our files.

93
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,270
We called a tool helper and we're defining it with a query.

94
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,910
I would just about set it with a back to 6 string.

95
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,620
I don't know if you've seen queries doing whatever.

96
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,710
And then we put the mutation itself inside of here.

97
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,570
So I think we're just about ready to import this into the sign up form.

98
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,430
We will wire it up to the sign up form and then I think that's a pretty good time to take a quick break

99
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,740
after that.

100
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,720
So I need to go back up to the sign up form we need to import both the mutation and the graph Kule helper

101
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,010
from the re-act Apollo library.

102
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,520
So import graphics.

103
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:22,390
Well from re-act Apollo and we'll import nutation from the mutations directory and I want to sign up

104
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,690
mutation in particular.

105
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:34,020
All right very last step we'll make sure that the very bottom we call the graphical helper passing the

106
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,130
mutation.

107
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,340
Second set of parentheses for the sign up form.

108
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,450
OK.

109
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,780
So this is looking like we're going down the right track here.

110
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,720
You know I've got to tell you I can only imagine that as we keep doing these same exact steps over and

111
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,350
over you're probably thinking oh my gosh discraft you all stuff is so boring.

112
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,030
We just keep on writing mutations and wiring them up to components that we just keep on doing over and

113
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,940
over again.

114
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,630
Well I can tell you what that's like one of the best things about graft.

115
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,800
Well we are just doing the same exact thing over and over and over and we don't have to worry about

116
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,710
all these one off edge cases that we sometimes have to do with other frameworks out there with graft.

117
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,840
Well we're just doing the same exact series of steps over and over again which I think is really just

118
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,690
fantastic because it allows us to put together these components in these applications much faster than

119
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,750
if we had to worry about every last edge case of how we're going to handle this stuff.

120
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,410
So my opinion Hey that's kind of a good thing.

121
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,980
I think it's a good thing.

122
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,740
So we've got our mutation hooked up to the sign of form.

123
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,370
Let's take a quick break and then we'll come back.

124
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,650
We'll define a callback to pass down into the form.

125
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,610
We'll also take care of a little bit of error handling and then we'll test this thing out inside the

126
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,470
browser.

127
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,440
SOSIA in just a second.
